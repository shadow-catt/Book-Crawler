      "\r\n",
      "Francesca Bassington sat in the drawing-room of her house in Blue\r\n",
      "Street, W., regaling herself and her estimable brother Henry with\r\n",
      "China tea and small cress sandwiches.  The meal was of that elegant\r\n",
      "proportion which, while ministering sympathetically to the desires\r\n",
      "of the moment, is happily reminiscent of a satisfactory luncheon\r\n",
      "and blessedly expectant of an elaborate dinner to come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In her younger days Francesca had been known as the beautiful Miss\r\n",
      "Greech; at forty, although much of the original beauty remained,\r\n",
      "she was just dear Francesca Bassington.  No one would have dreamed\r\n",
      "of calling her sweet, but a good many people who scarcely knew her\r\n",
      "were punctilious about putting in the \"dear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her enemies, in their honester moments, would have admitted that\r\n",
      "she was svelte and knew how to dress, but they would have agreed\r\n",
      "with her friends in asserting that she had no soul.  When one's\r\n",
      "friends and enemies agree on any particular point they are usually\r\n",
      "wrong.  Francesca herself, if pressed in an unguarded moment to\r\n",
      "describe her soul, would probably have described her drawing-room.\r\n",
      "Not that she would have considered that the one had stamped the\r\n",
      "impress of its character on the other, so that close scrutiny might\r\n",
      "reveal its outstanding features, and even suggest its hidden\r\n",
      "places, but because she might have dimly recognised that her\r\n",
      "drawing-room was her soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francesca was one of those women towards whom Fate appears to have\r\n",
      "the best intentions and never to carry them into practice.  With\r\n",
      "the advantages put at her disposal she might have been expected to\r\n",
      "command a more than average share of feminine happiness.  So many\r\n",
      "of the things that make for fretfulness, disappointment and\r\n",
      "discouragement in a woman's life were removed from her path that\r\n",
      "she might well have been considered the fortunate Miss Greech, or\r\n",
      "later, lucky Francesca Bassington.  And she was not of the perverse\r\n",
      "band of those who make a rock-garden of their souls by dragging\r\n",
      "into them all the stoney griefs and unclaimed troubles they can\r\n",
      "find lying around them.  Francesca loved the smooth ways and\r\n",
      "pleasant places of life; she liked not merely to look on the bright\r\n",
      "side of things but to live there and stay there.  And the fact that\r\n",
      "things had, at one time and another, gone badly with her and\r\n",
      "cheated her of some of her early illusions made her cling the\r\n",
      "closer to such good fortune as remained to her now that she seemed\r\n",
      "to have reached a calmer period of her life.  To undiscriminating\r\n",
      "friends she appeared in the guise of a rather selfish woman, but it\r\n",
      "was merely the selfishness of one who had seen the happy and\r\n",
      "unhappy sides of life and wished to enjoy to the utmost what was\r\n",
      "left to her of the former.  The vicissitudes of fortune had not\r\n",
      "soured her, but they had perhaps narrowed her in the sense of\r\n",
      "making her concentrate much of her sympathies on things that\r\n",
      "immediately pleased and amused her, or that recalled and\r\n",
      "perpetuated the pleasing and successful incidents of other days.\r\n",
      "And it was her drawing-room in particular that enshrined the\r\n",
      "memorials or tokens of past and present happiness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Into that comfortable quaint-shaped room of angles and bays and\r\n",
      "alcoves had sailed, as into a harbour, those precious personal\r\n",
      "possessions and trophies that had survived the buffetings and\r\n",
      "storms of a not very tranquil married life.  Wherever her eyes\r\n",
      "might turn she saw the embodied results of her successes,\r\n",
      "economies, good luck, good management or good taste.  The battle\r\n",
      "had more than once gone against her, but she had somehow always\r\n",
      "contrived to save her baggage train, and her complacent gaze could\r\n",
      "roam over object after object that represented the spoils of\r\n",
      "victory or the salvage of honourable defeat.  The delicious bronze\r\n",
      "Fremiet on the mantelpiece had been the outcome of a Grand Prix\r\n",
      "sweepstake of many years ago; a group of Dresden figures of some\r\n",
      "considerable value had been bequeathed to her by a discreet\r\n",
      "admirer, who had added death to his other kindnesses; another group\r\n",
      "had been a self-bestowed present, purchased in blessed and unfading\r\n",
      "memory of a wonderful nine-days' bridge winnings at a country-house\r\n",
      "party.  There were old Persian and Bokharan rugs and Worcester tea-\r\n",
      "services of glowing colour, and little treasures of antique silver\r\n",
      "that each enshrined a history or a memory in addition to its own\r\n",
      "intrinsic value.  It amused her at times to think of the bygone\r\n",
      "craftsmen and artificers who had hammered and wrought and woven in\r\n",
      "far distant countries and ages, to produce the wonderful and\r\n",
      "beautiful things that had come, one way and another, into her\r\n",
      "possession.  Workers in the studios of medieval Italian towns and\r\n",
      "of later Paris, in the bazaars of Baghdad and of Central Asia, in\r\n",
      "old-time English workshops and German factories, in all manner of\r\n",
      "queer hidden corners where craft secrets were jealously guarded,\r\n",
      "nameless unremembered men and men whose names were world-renowned\r\n",
      "and deathless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And above all her other treasures, dominating in her estimation\r\n",
      "every other object that the room contained, was the great Van der\r\n",
      "Meulen that had come from her father's home as part of her wedding\r\n",
      "dowry.  It fitted exactly into the central wall panel above the\r\n",
      "narrow buhl cabinet, and filled exactly its right space in the\r\n",
      "composition and balance of the room.  From wherever you sat it\r\n",
      "seemed to confront you as the dominating feature of its\r\n",
      "surroundings.  There was a pleasing serenity about the great\r\n",
      "pompous battle scene with its solemn courtly warriors bestriding\r\n",
      "their heavily prancing steeds, grey or skewbald or dun, all gravely\r\n",
      "in earnest, and yet somehow conveying the impression that their\r\n",
      "campaigns were but vast serious picnics arranged in the grand\r\n",
      "manner.  Francesca could not imagine the drawing-room without the\r\n",
      "crowning complement of the stately well-hung picture, just as she\r\n",
      "could not imagine herself in any other setting than this house in\r\n",
      "Blue Street with its crowded Pantheon of cherished household gods.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And herein sprouted one of the thorns that obtruded through the\r\n",
      "rose-leaf damask of what might otherwise have been Francesca's\r\n",
      "peace of mind.  One's happiness always lies in the future rather\r\n",
      "than in the past.  With due deference to an esteemed lyrical\r\n",
      "authority one may safely say that a sorrow's crown of sorrow is\r\n",
      "anticipating unhappier things.  The house in Blue Street had been\r\n",
      "left to her by her old friend Sophie Chetrof, but only until such\r\n",
      "time as her niece Emmeline Chetrof should marry, when it was to\r\n",
      "pass to her as a wedding present.  Emmeline was now seventeen and\r\n",
      "passably good-looking, and four or five years were all that could\r\n",
      "be safely allotted to the span of her continued spinsterhood.\r\n",
      "Beyond that period lay chaos, the wrenching asunder of Francesca\r\n",
      "from the sheltering habitation that had grown to be her soul.  It\r\n",
      "is true that in imagination she had built herself a bridge across\r\n",
      "the chasm, a bridge of a single span.  The bridge in question was\r\n",
      "her schoolboy son Comus, now being educated somewhere in the\r\n",
      "southern counties, or rather one should say the bridge consisted of\r\n",
      "the possibility of his eventual marriage with Emmeline, in which\r\n",
      "case Francesca saw herself still reigning, a trifle squeezed and\r\n",
      "incommoded perhaps, but still reigning in the house in Blue Street.\r\n",
      "The Van der Meulen would still catch its requisite afternoon light\r\n",
      "in its place of honour, the Fremiet and the Dresden and Old\r\n",
      "Worcester would continue undisturbed in their accustomed niches.\r\n",
      "Emmeline could have the Japanese snuggery, where Francesca\r\n",
      "sometimes drank her after-dinner coffee, as a separate drawing-\r\n",
      "room, where she could put her own things.  The details of the\r\n",
      "bridge structure had all been carefully thought out.  Only--it was\r\n",
      "an unfortunate circumstance that Comus should have been the span on\r\n",
      "which everything balanced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francesca's husband had insisted on giving the boy that strange\r\n",
      "Pagan name, and had not lived long enough to judge as to the\r\n",
      "appropriateness, or otherwise, of its significance.  In seventeen\r\n",
      "years and some odd months Francesca had had ample opportunity for\r\n",
      "forming an opinion concerning her son's characteristics.  The\r\n",
      "spirit of mirthfulness which one associates with the name certainly\r\n",
      "ran riot in the boy, but it was a twisted wayward sort of mirth of\r\n",
      "which Francesca herself could seldom see the humorous side.  In her\r\n",
      "brother Henry, who sat eating small cress sandwiches as solemnly as\r\n",
      "though they had been ordained in some immemorial Book of\r\n",
      "Observances, fate had been undisguisedly kind to her.  He might so\r\n",
      "easily have married some pretty helpless little woman, and lived at\r\n",
      "Notting Hill Gate, and been the father of a long string of pale,\r\n",
      "clever useless children, who would have had birthdays and the sort\r\n",
      "of illnesses that one is expected to send grapes to, and who would\r\n",
      "have painted fatuous objects in a South Kensington manner as\r\n",
      "Christmas offerings to an aunt whose cubic space for lumber was\r\n",
      "limited.  Instead of committing these unbrotherly actions, which\r\n",
      "are so frequent in family life that they might almost be called\r\n",
      "brotherly, Henry had married a woman who had both money and a sense\r\n",
      "of repose, and their one child had the brilliant virtue of never\r\n",
      "saying anything which even its parents could consider worth\r\n",
      "repeating.  Then he had gone into Parliament, possibly with the\r\n",
      "idea of making his home life seem less dull; at any rate it\r\n",
      "redeemed his career from insignificance, for no man whose death can\r\n",
      "produce the item \"another by-election\" on the news posters can be\r\n",
      "wholly a nonentity.  Henry, in short, who might have been an\r\n",
      "embarrassment and a handicap, had chosen rather to be a friend and\r\n",
      "counsellor, at times even an emergency bank balance; Francesca on\r\n",
      "her part, with the partiality which a clever and lazily-inclined\r\n",
      "woman often feels for a reliable fool, not only sought his counsel\r\n",
      "but frequently followed it.  When convenient, moreover, she repaid\r\n",
      "his loans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Against this good service on the part of Fate in providing her with\r\n",
      "Henry for a brother, Francesca could well set the plaguy malice of\r\n",
      "the destiny that had given her Comus for a son.  The boy was one of\r\n",
      "those untameable young lords of misrule that frolic and chafe\r\n",
      "themselves through nursery and preparatory and public-school days\r\n",
      "with the utmost allowance of storm and dust and dislocation and the\r\n",
      "least possible amount of collar-work, and come somehow with a laugh\r\n",
      "through a series of catastrophes that has reduced everyone else\r\n",
      "concerned to tears or Cassandra-like forebodings.  Sometimes they\r\n",
      "sober down in after-life and become uninteresting, forgetting that\r\n",
      "they were ever lords of anything; sometimes Fate plays royally into\r\n",
      "their hands, and they do great things in a spacious manner, and are\r\n",
      "thanked by Parliaments and the Press and acclaimed by gala-day\r\n",
      "crowds.  But in most cases their tragedy begins when they leave\r\n",
      "school and turn themselves loose in a world that has grown too\r\n",
      "civilised and too crowded and too empty to have any place for them.\r\n",
      "And they are very many.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Henry Greech had made an end of biting small sandwiches, and\r\n",
      "settled down like a dust-storm refreshed, to discuss one of the\r\n",
      "fashionably prevalent topics of the moment, the prevention of\r\n",
      "destitution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the dilettante and academic way of approaching it.  We must collect\r\n",
      "and assimilate hard facts.  It is a subject that ought to appeal to\r\n",

      "thing if she could be induced to keep her own personality a little\r\n",
      "more in the background, and not to imagine that she is the\r\n",
      "necessary mouthpiece of all the progressive thought in the\r\n",
      "countryside.  I fancy Canon Besomley must have had her in his mind\r\n",

      "known, and outside the masters' common-room he enjoyed a certain\r\n",
      "fitful popularity, or at any rate admiration.  At football he was\r\n",
      "too erratic to be a really brilliant player, but he tackled as if\r\n",
      "the act of bringing his man headlong to the ground was in itself a\r\n",
      "sensuous pleasure, and his weird swear-words whenever he got hurt\r\n",
      "were eagerly treasured by those who were fortunate enough to hear\r\n",

      "sourness in him Comus might have been leavened into something\r\n",
      "creative and masterful; fate had fashioned him with a certain\r\n",

      "through the crowd that filled the rooms of her friend Serena\r\n",
      "Golackly, bestowing nods of vague recognition as she went, but with\r\n",
      "eyes that were obviously intent on focussing one particular figure.\r\n",
      "Parliament had pulled its energies together for an Autumn Session,\r\n",
      "and both political Parties were fairly well represented in the\r\n",
      "throng.  Serena had a harmless way of inviting a number of more or\r\n",
      "less public men and women to her house, and hoping that if you left\r\n",
      "them together long enough they would constitute a salon.  In\r\n",

      "leaving unsaid.  One group that Francesca passed was discussing a\r\n",

      "politician's associates and admirers, and as the boy knew and cared\r\n",
      "nothing about politics, and merely copied Youghal's waistcoats,\r\n",

      "and sedulously fostered as occasion permitted, until all that was\r\n",

      "remote shark-girt island, as he expressed it, with the Jull family\r\n",
      "as his chief social mainstay, and Sir Julian's conversation as a\r\n",
      "daily item of his existence, did not inspire him with the same\r\n",

      "after all, were not making the experiment.  Even the necessity for\r\n",
      "an entirely new outfit did not appeal to his imagination with the\r\n",
      "force that might have been expected.  But, however lukewarm his\r\n",
      "adhesion to the project might be, Francesca and her brother were\r\n",
      "clearly determined that no lack of deft persistence on their part\r\n",
      "should endanger its success.  It was for the purpose of reminding\r\n",
      "Sir Julian of his promise to meet Comus at lunch on the following\r\n",
      "day, and definitely settle the matter of the secretaryship that\r\n",

      "listeners dexterously detached themselves one by one, but\r\n",
      "Francesca's patience outlasted even Sir Julian's flow of\r\n",
      "commonplaces, and her devotion was duly rewarded by a renewed\r\n",
      "acknowledgment of the lunch engagement and its purpose.  She pushed\r\n",

      "of the letter was a cruel dis-interment of some fatuous and\r\n",
      "forgotten speeches made by Sir Julian to his constituents not many\r\n",
      "years ago, in which the value of some of our Colonial possessions,\r\n",
      "particularly certain West Indian islands, was decried in a medley\r\n",
      "of pomposity, ignorance and amazingly cheap humour.  The extracts\r\n",
      "given sounded weak and foolish enough, taken by themselves, but the\r\n",
      "writer of the letter had interlarded them with comments of his own,\r\n",
      "which sparkled with an ironical brilliance that was Cervantes-like\r\n",
      "in its polished cruelty.  Remembering her ordeal of the previous\r\n",
      "evening Francesca permitted herself a certain feeling of amusement\r\n",
      "as she read the merciless stabs inflicted on the newly-appointed\r\n",
      "Governor; then she came to the signature at the foot of the letter,\r\n",

      "once the pride of authorship in a clever piece of political\r\n",
      "raillery, and letting his young friend stand sponsor instead.  It\r\n",
      "was a daring stroke, and there could be no question as to its\r\n",
      "success; the secretaryship and the distant shark-girt island faded\r\n",
      "away into the horizon of impossible things.  Francesca, forgetting\r\n",
      "the golden rule of strategy which enjoins a careful choosing of\r\n",
      "ground and opportunity before entering on hostilities, made\r\n",

      "as sons they would have been eminently restful.  With a growing\r\n",

      "with her own intractable offspring, and wondered why Fate should\r\n",

      "equally careful though less open scrutiny of the girl who sat\r\n",
      "opposite her, the girl who was nobody in particular, but whose\r\n",
      "income was everything that could be desired.  She was pretty in a\r\n",
      "restrained nut-brown fashion, and had a look of grave reflective\r\n",
      "calm that probably masked a speculative unsettled temperament.  Her\r\n",
      "pose, if one wished to be critical, was just a little too\r\n",
      "elaborately careless.  She wore some excellently set rubies with\r\n",

      "seemed to be only moderately interested in the conversational\r\n",
      "efforts of the diners on either side of her.  Comus who was looking\r\n",
      "and talking his best, was sitting at the further end of the table,\r\n",

      "young people met and a swift flush of pleasure and a half-smile\r\n",

      "admiration.  For the first time for many, many months Francesca saw\r\n",
      "her son's prospects in a rose-coloured setting, and she began,\r\n",
      "unconsciously, to wonder exactly how much wealth was summed up in\r\n",
      "the expressive label \"almost indecently rich.\"  A wife with a\r\n",
      "really large fortune and a correspondingly big dower of character\r\n",
      "and ambition, might, perhaps, succeed in turning Comus's latent\r\n",
      "energies into a groove which would provide him, if not with a\r\n",
      "career, at least with an occupation, and the young serious face\r\n",

      "dangerous rival.  Against the good looks and fitful powers of\r\n",
      "fascination that Comus could bring into the field, the young\r\n",
      "politician could match half-a-dozen dazzling qualities which would\r\n",

      "a certain responsive affection.  She had always obviously admired\r\n",
      "him, and at the same time she never beset him with crude flattery;\r\n",
      "the principal reason why the flirtation had stood the test of so\r\n",

      "the least on friendship or community of tastes and ideas, but owed\r\n",

      "careless sincerity, which would probably in the long run save him\r\n",
      "from moderate success, and turn him into one of the brilliant\r\n",
      "failures of his day.  Beyond this it was difficult to form an exact\r\n",
      "appreciation of Courtenay Youghal, and Elaine, who liked to have\r\n",
      "her impressions distinctly labelled and pigeon-holed, was\r\n",
      "perpetually scrutinising the outer surface of his characteristics\r\n",
      "and utterances, like a baffled art critic vainly searching beneath\r\n",
      "the varnish and scratches of a doubtfully assigned picture for an\r\n",
      "enlightening signature.  The young man added to her perplexities by\r\n",
      "his deliberate policy of never trying to show himself in a\r\n",
      "favourable light even when most anxious to impart a favourable\r\n",
      "impression.  He preferred that people should hunt for his good\r\n",
      "qualities, and merely took very good care that as far as possible\r\n",
      "they should never draw blank; even in the matter of selfishness,\r\n",
      "which was the anchor-sheet of his existence, he contrived to be\r\n",
      "noted, and justly noted, for doing remarkably unselfish things.  As\r\n",
      "a ruler he would have been reasonably popular; as a husband he\r\n",
      "would probably be unendurable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Comus was to a certain extent as great a mystification as Youghal,\r\n",
      "but here Elaine was herself responsible for some of the perplexity\r\n",
      "which enshrouded his character in her eyes.  She had taken more\r\n",
      "than a passing fancy for the boy--for the boy as he might be, that\r\n",
      "was to say--and she was desperately unwilling to see him and\r\n",
      "appraise him as he really was.  Thus the mental court of appeal was\r\n",
      "constantly engaged in examining witnesses as to character, most of\r\n",
      "whom signally failed to give any testimony which would support the\r\n",
      "favourable judgment which the tribunal was so anxious to arrive at.\r\n",
      "A woman with wider experience of the world's ways and shortcomings\r\n",
      "would probably have contented herself with an endeavour to find out\r\n",
      "whether her liking for the boy outweighed her dislike of his\r\n",
      "characteristics; Elaine took her judgments too seriously to\r\n",
      "approach the matter from such a simple and convenient standpoint.\r\n",
      "The fact that she was much more than half in love with Comus made\r\n",
      "it dreadfully important that she should discover him to have a\r\n",
      "lovable soul, and Comus, it must be confessed, did little to help\r\n",
      "forward the discovery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At any rate he is honest,\" she would observe to herself, after\r\n",
      "some outspoken admission of unprincipled conduct on his part, and\r\n",
      "then she would ruefully recall certain episodes in which he had\r\n",
      "figured, from which honesty had been conspicuously absent.  What\r\n",
      "she tried to label honesty in his candour was probably only a\r\n",
      "cynical defiance of the laws of right and wrong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You look more than usually thoughtful this afternoon,\" said Comus\r\n",
      "to her, \"as if you had invented this summer day and were trying to\r\n",
      "think out improvements.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I had the power to create improvements anywhere I think I\r\n",
      "should begin with you,\" retorted Elaine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure it's much better to leave me as I am,\" protested Comus;\r\n",
      "\"you're like a relative of mine up in Argyllshire, who spends his\r\n",
      "time producing improved breeds of sheep and pigs and chickens.  So\r\n",
      "patronising and irritating to the Almighty I should think, to go\r\n",
      "about putting superior finishing touches to Creation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine frowned, and then laughed, and finally gave a little sigh.\r\n",

      "\"It's not easy to talk sense to you,\" she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Whatever else you take in hand,\" said Youghal, \"you must never\r\n",
      "improve this garden.  It's what our idea of Heaven might be like if\r\n",
      "the Jews hadn't invented one for us on totally different lines.\r\n",
      "It's dreadful that we should accept them as the impresarios of our\r\n",
      "religious dreamland instead of the Greeks.\"\r\n",

      "England no one really is anti-Semitic.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Youghal shook his head.  \"I know a great many Jews who are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Servants had quietly, almost reverently, placed tea and its\r\n",
      "accessories on the wicker table, and quietly receded from the\r\n",
      "landscape.  Elaine sat like a grave young goddess about to dispense\r\n",
      "some mysterious potion to her devotees.  Her mind was still sitting\r\n",
      "in judgment on the Jewish question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Comus scrambled to his feet.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And he walked off with a little silver basket-dish containing brown\r\n",
      "bread-and-butter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine laughed quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's so like Comus,\" she said, \"to go off with our one dish of\r\n",
      "bread-and-butter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Youghal chuckled responsively.  It was an undoubted opportunity for\r\n",
      "him to put in some disparaging criticism of Comus, and Elaine sat\r\n",
      "alert in readiness to judge the critic and reserve judgment on the\r\n",
      "criticised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His selfishness is splendid but absolutely futile,\" said Youghal;\r\n",
      "\"now my selfishness is commonplace, but always thoroughly practical\r\n",
      "and calculated.  He will have great difficulty in getting the swans\r\n",
      "to accept his offering, and he incurs the odium of reducing us to a\r\n",
      "bread-and-butterless condition.  Incidentally he will get very\r\n",
      "hot.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine again had the sense of being thoroughly baffled.  If Youghal\r\n",
      "had said anything unkind it was about himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If my cousin Suzette had been here,\" she observed, with the shadow\r\n",
      "of a malicious smile on her lips, \"I believe she would have gone\r\n",
      "into a flood of tears at the loss of her bread-and-butter, and\r\n",
      "Comus would have figured ever after in her mind as something black\r\n",
      "and destroying and hateful.  In fact I don't really know why we\r\n",
      "took our loss so unprotestingly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For two reasons,\" said Youghal; \"you are rather fond of Comus.\r\n",
      "And I--am not very fond of bread-and-butter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The jesting remark brought a throb of pleasure to Elaine's heart.\r\n",
      "She had known full well that she cared for Comus, but now that\r\n",
      "Courtenay Youghal had openly proclaimed the fact as something\r\n",
      "unchallenged and understood matters seemed placed at once on a more\r\n",
      "advanced footing.  The warm sunlit garden grew suddenly into a\r\n",
      "Heaven that held the secret of eternal happiness.  Youth and\r\n",
      "comeliness would always walk here, under the low-boughed mulberry\r\n",
      "trees, as unchanging as the leaden otter that for ever preyed on\r\n",
      "the leaden salmon on the edge of the old fountain, and somehow the\r\n",
      "lovers would always wear the aspect of herself and the boy who was\r\n",
      "talking to the four white swans by the water steps.  Youghal was\r\n",
      "right; this was the real Heaven of one's dreams and longings,\r\n",
      "immeasurably removed from that Rue de la Paix Paradise about which\r\n",
      "one professed utterly insincere hankerings in places of public\r\n",
      "worship.  Elaine drank her tea in a happy silence; besides being a\r\n",
      "brilliant talker Youghal understood the rarer art of being a non-\r\n",
      "talker on occasion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Swans were very pleased,\" he cried, gaily, \"and said they hoped I\r\n",
      "would keep the bread-and-butter dish as a souvenir of a happy tea-\r\n",
      "party.  I may really have it, mayn't I?\" he continued in an anxious\r\n",

      "\"I'll have that scratched off and my own put on,\" said Comus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's been in the family for generations,\" protested Elaine, who\r\n",
      "did not share Comus's view that because you were rich your lesser\r\n",
      "possessions could have no value in your eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I want it dreadfully,\" said Comus, sulkily, \"and you've heaps of\r\n",
      "other things to put bread-and-butter in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the moment he was possessed by an overmastering desire to keep\r\n",
      "the dish at all costs; a look of greedy determination dominated his\r\n",
      "face, and he had not for an instant relaxed his grip of the coveted\r\n",
      "object.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine was genuinely angry by this time, and was busily telling\r\n",
      "herself that it was absurd to be put out over such a trifle; at the\r\n",
      "same moment a sense of justice was telling her that Comus was\r\n",
      "displaying a good deal of rather shabby selfishness.  And somehow\r\n",
      "her chief anxiety at the moment was to keep Courtenay Youghal from\r\n",
      "seeing that she was angry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know you don't really want it, so I'm going to keep it,\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"It's too hot to argue,\" said Elaine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Happy mistress of your destinies,\" laughed Youghal; \"you can suit\r\n",
      "your disputations to the desired time and temperature.  I have to\r\n",
      "go and argue, or what is worse, listen to other people's arguments,\r\n",
      "in a hot and doctored atmosphere suitable to an invalid lizard.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You haven't got to argue about a bread-and-butter dish,\" said\r\n",
      "Elaine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Chiefly about bread-and-butter,\" said Youghal; \"our great\r\n",
      "preoccupation is other people's bread-and-butter.  They earn or\r\n",
      "produce the material, but we busy ourselves with making rules how\r\n",
      "it shall be cut up, and the size of the slices, and how much butter\r\n",
      "shall go on how much bread.  That is what is called legislation.\r\n",
      "If we could only make rules as to how the bread-and-butter should\r\n",
      "be digested we should be quite happy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine had been brought up to regard Parliaments as something to be\r\n",
      "treated with cheerful solemnity, like illness or family re-unions.\r\n",
      "Youghal's flippant disparagement of the career in which he was\r\n",
      "involved did not, however, jar on her susceptibilities.  She knew\r\n",
      "him to be not only a lively and effective debater but an\r\n",
      "industrious worker on committees.  If he made light of his labours,\r\n",
      "at least he afforded no one else a loophole for doing so.  And\r\n",
      "certainly, the Parliamentary atmosphere was not inviting on this\r\n",
      "hot afternoon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When must you go?\" she asked, sympathetically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Youghal looked ruefully at his watch.  Before he could answer, a\r\n",
      "cheerful hoot came through the air, as of an owl joyously\r\n",
      "challenging the sunlight with a foreboding of the coming night.  He\r\n",
      "sprang laughing to his feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Listen!  My summons back to my galley,\" he cried.  \"The Gods have\r\n",
      "given me an hour in this enchanted garden, so I must not complain.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then in a lower voice he almost whispered, \"It's the Persian debate\r\n",
      "to-night,\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the one hint he had given in the midst of his talking and\r\n",
      "laughing that he was really keenly enthralled in the work that lay\r\n",
      "before him.  It was the one little intimate touch that gave Elaine\r\n",
      "the knowledge that he cared for her opinion of his work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Comus, who had emptied his cigarette-case, became suddenly\r\n",
      "clamorous at the prospect of being temporarily stranded without a\r\n",
      "smoke.  Youghal took the last remaining cigarette from his own case\r\n",
      "and gravely bisected it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Friendship could go no further,\" he observed, as he gave one-half\r\n",
      "to the doubtfully appeased Comus, and lit the other himself.\r\n",

      "The departing galley-slave stepped forth into the sunlight, radiant\r\n",
      "and confident.  A few minutes later Elaine could see glimpses of\r\n",
      "his white car as it rushed past the rhododendron bushes.  He woos\r\n",
      "best who leaves first, particularly if he goes forth to battle or\r\n",
      "the semblance of battle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Somehow Elaine's garden of Eternal Youth had already become clouded\r\n",
      "in its imagery.  The girl-figure who walked in it was still\r\n",

      "Towards four o'clock on a hot afternoon Francesca stepped out from\r\n",
      "a shop entrance near the Piccadilly end of Bond Street and ran\r\n",
      "almost into the arms of Merla Blathlington.  The afternoon seemed\r\n",
      "to get instantly hotter.  Merla was one of those human flies that\r\n",
      "buzz; in crowded streets, at bazaars and in warm weather, she\r\n",
      "attained to the proportions of a human bluebottle.  Lady Caroline\r\n",
      "Benaresq had openly predicted that a special fly-paper was being\r\n",
      "reserved for her accommodation in another world; others, however,\r\n",
      "held the opinion that she would be miraculously multiplied in a\r\n",
      "future state, and that four or more Merla Blathlingtons, according\r\n",
      "to deserts, would be in perpetual and unremitting attendance on\r\n",
      "each lost soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here we are,\" she cried, with a glad eager buzz, \"popping in and\r\n",
      "out of shops like rabbits; not that rabbits do pop in and out of\r\n",
      "shops very extensively.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was evidently one of her bluebottle days.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you love Bond Street?\" she gabbled on.  \"There's something\r\n",
      "so unusual and distinctive about it; no other street anywhere else\r\n",
      "is quite like it.  Don't you know those ikons and images and things\r\n",
      "scattered up and down Europe, that are supposed to have been\r\n",
      "painted or carved, as the case may be, by St. Luke or Zaccheus, or\r\n",
      "somebody of that sort; I always like to think that some notable\r\n",
      "person of those times designed Bond Street.  St. Paul, perhaps.  He\r\n",
      "travelled about a lot.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not in Middlesex, though,\" said Francesca.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One can't be sure,\" persisted Merla; \"when one wanders about as\r\n",
      "much as he did one gets mixed up and forgets where one HAS been.  I\r\n",
      "can never remember whether I've been to the Tyrol twice and St.\r\n",
      "Moritz once, or the other way about; I always have to ask my maid.\r\n",
      "And there's something about the name Bond that suggests St. Paul;\r\n",
      "didn't he write a lot about the bond and the free?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I fancy he wrote in Hebrew or Greek,\" objected Francesca; \"the\r\n",
      "word wouldn't have the least resemblance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So dreadfully non-committal to go about pamphleteering in those\r\n",
      "bizarre languages,\" complained Merla; \"that's what makes all those\r\n",
      "people so elusive.  As soon as you try to pin them down to a\r\n",
      "definite statement about anything you're told that some vitally\r\n",
      "important word has fifteen other meanings in the original.  I\r\n",
      "wonder our Cabinet Ministers and politicians don't adopt a sort of\r\n",
      "dog-Latin or Esperanto jargon to deliver their speeches in; what a\r\n",
      "lot of subsequent explaining away would be saved.  But to go back\r\n",
      "to Bond Street--not that we've left it--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I must leave it now,\" said Francesca, preparing to turn\r\n",
      "up Grafton Street; \"Good-bye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Must you be going?  Come and have tea somewhere.  I know of a cosy\r\n",
      "little place where one can talk undisturbed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francesca repressed a shudder and pleaded an urgent engagement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know where you're going,\" said Merla, with the resentful buzz of\r\n",
      "a bluebottle that finds itself thwarted by the cold unreasoning\r\n",
      "resistance of a windowpane.  \"You're going to play bridge at Serena\r\n",
      "Golackly's.  She never asks me to her bridge parties.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francesca shuddered openly this time; the prospect of having to\r\n",
      "play bridge anywhere in the near neighbourhood of Merla's voice was\r\n",
      "not one that could be contemplated with ordinary calmness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye,\" she said again firmly, and passed out of earshot; it\r\n",
      "was rather like leaving the machinery section of an exhibition.\r\n",
      "Merla's diagnosis of her destination had been a correct one;\r\n",
      "Francesca made her way slowly through the hot streets in the\r\n",
      "direction of Serena Golackly's house on the far side of Berkeley\r\n",
      "Square.  To the blessed certainty of finding a game of bridge, she\r\n",
      "hopefully added the possibility of hearing some fragments of news\r\n",
      "which might prove interesting and enlightening.  And of\r\n",
      "enlightenment on a particular subject, in which she was acutely and\r\n",
      "personally interested, she stood in some need.  Comus of late had\r\n",
      "been provokingly reticent as to his movements and doings; partly,\r\n",
      "perhaps, because it was his nature to be provoking, partly because\r\n",
      "the daily bickerings over money matters were gradually choking\r\n",
      "other forms of conversation.  Francesca had seen him once or twice\r\n",
      "in the Park in the desirable company of Elaine de Frey, and from\r\n",
      "time to time she heard of the young people as having danced\r\n",
      "together at various houses; on the other hand, she had seen and\r\n",

      "that of Courtenay Youghal.  Beyond this meagre and conflicting and\r\n",
      "altogether tantalising information, her knowledge of the present\r\n",
      "position of affairs did not go.  If either of the young men was\r\n",
      "seriously \"making the running,\" it was probable that she would hear\r\n",
      "some sly hint or open comment about it from one of Serena's gossip-\r\n",

      "subject and unduly disclose her own state of ignorance.  And a game\r\n",
      "of bridge, played for moderately high points, gave ample excuse for\r\n",
      "convenient lapses into reticence; if questions took an\r\n",
      "embarrassingly inquisitive turn, one could always find refuge in a\r\n",
      "defensive spade.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The afternoon was too warm to make bridge a generally popular\r\n",
      "diversion, and Serena's party was a comparatively small one.  Only\r\n",
      "one table was incomplete when Francesca made her appearance on the\r\n",
      "scene; at it was seated Serena herself, confronted by Ada\r\n",
      "Spelvexit, whom everyone was wont to explain as \"one of the\r\n",
      "Cheshire Spelvexits,\" as though any other variety would have been\r\n",
      "intolerable.  Ada Spelvexit was one of those naturally stagnant\r\n",
      "souls who take infinite pleasure in what are called \"movements.\"\r\n",
      "\"Most of the really great lessons I have learned have been taught\r\n",
      "me by the Poor,\" was one of her favourite statements.  The one\r\n",
      "great lesson that the Poor in general would have liked to have\r\n",
      "taught her, that their kitchens and sickrooms were not unreservedly\r\n",
      "at her disposal as private lecture halls, she had never been able\r\n",
      "to assimilate.  She was ready to give them unlimited advice as to\r\n",
      "how they should keep the wolf from their doors, but in return she\r\n",
      "claimed and enforced for herself the penetrating powers of an east\r\n",
      "wind or a dust storm.  Her visits among her wealthier acquaintances\r\n",
      "were equally extensive and enterprising, and hardly more welcome;\r\n",
      "in country-house parties, while partaking to the fullest extent of\r\n",
      "the hospitality offered her, she made a practice of unburdening\r\n",
      "herself of homilies on the evils of leisure and luxury, which did\r\n",
      "not particularly endear her to her fellow guests.  Hostesses\r\n",
      "regarded her philosophically as a form of social measles which\r\n",
      "everyone had to have once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The third prospective player, Francesca noted without any special\r\n",
      "enthusiasm, was Lady Caroline Benaresq.  Lady Caroline was far from\r\n",
      "being a remarkably good bridge player, but she always managed to\r\n",
      "domineer mercilessly over any table that was favoured with her\r\n",
      "presence, and generally managed to win.  A domineering player\r\n",
      "usually inflicts the chief damage and demoralisation on his\r\n",

      "demoralise partner and opponents alike.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Weak and weak,\" she announced in her gentle voice, as she cut her\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "inwardly relieved and rejoicing at the reasonable figure proposed\r\n",
      "by Lady Caroline, and she would certainly have demurred if a higher\r\n",
      "stake had been suggested.  She was not as a rule a successful\r\n",

      "to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then as you don't mind we'll make it ten shillings a hundred,\"\r\n",
      "said Lady Caroline, with the pleased chuckle of one who has spread\r\n",
      "a net in the sight of a bird and disproved the vanity of the\r\n",
      "proceeding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It proved a tiresome ding-dong rubber, with the strength of the\r\n",
      "cards slightly on Francesca's side, and the luck of the table going\r\n",
      "mostly the other way.  She was too keen a player not to feel a\r\n",
      "certain absorption in the game once it had started, but she was\r\n",
      "conscious to-day of a distracting interest that competed with the\r\n",
      "momentary importance of leads and discards and declarations.  The\r\n",
      "little accumulations of talk that were unpent during the dealing of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Ada Spelvexit gave up the attempt to reproduce the decorative\r\n",
      "setting of the Canon's homelife, and fell back on the small but\r\n",

      "rather in form.  I disagree entirely with his point of view, of\r\n",
      "course, but some of the things he says have just enough truth\r\n",
      "behind them to redeem them from being merely smart; for instance,\r\n",
      "his summing up of the Government's attitude towards our\r\n",
      "embarrassing Colonial Empire in the wistful phrase 'happy is the\r\n",
      "country that has no geography.'\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Most politicians are something or other at heart, but no one would\r\n",

      "opportunity for turning the talk more directly on him and his\r\n",

      "\"I think he's got a career before him,\" said Serena; \"the House\r\n",
      "always fills when he's speaking, and that's a good sign.  And then\r\n",
      "he's young and got rather an attractive personality, which is\r\n",
      "always something in the political world.\"\r\n",

      "\"His lack of money will handicap him, unless he can find himself a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And she half sighed, as though she almost regretted that a previous\r\n",

      "competition on her own account.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francesca, under an assumption of languid interest, was watching\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "long as human memory can recall them.  A close-cut peaked beard\r\n",
      "lent a certain dignity to his appearance--a loan which the rest of\r\n",
      "his features and mannerisms were continually and successfully\r\n",
      "repudiating.  His profession, if he had one, was submerged in his\r\n",
      "hobby, which consisted of being an advance-agent for small\r\n",
      "happenings or possible happenings that were or seemed imminent in\r\n",
      "the social world around him; he found a perpetual and unflagging\r\n",
      "satisfaction in acquiring and retailing any stray items of gossip\r\n",
      "or information, particularly of a matrimonial nature, that chanced\r\n",
      "to come his way.  Given the bare outline of an officially announced\r\n",
      "engagement he would immediately fill it in with all manner of\r\n",
      "details, true or, at any rate, probable, drawn from his own\r\n",
      "imagination or from some equally exclusive source.  The Morning\r\n",
      "Post might content itself with the mere statement of the\r\n",
      "arrangement which would shortly take place, but it was St.\r\n",
      "Michael's breathless little voice that proclaimed how the\r\n",
      "contracting parties had originally met over a salmon-fishing\r\n",
      "incident, why the Guards' Chapel would not be used, why her Aunt\r\n",
      "Mary had at first opposed the match, how the question of the\r\n",
      "children's religious upbringing had been compromised, etc., etc.,\r\n",
      "to all whom it might interest and to many whom it might not.\r\n",
      "Beyond his industriously-earned pre-eminence in this special branch\r\n",
      "of intelligence, he was chiefly noteworthy for having a wife\r\n",
      "reputed to be the tallest and thinnest woman in the Home Counties.\r\n",
      "The two were sometimes seen together in Society, where they passed\r\n",

      "little late,\" he repeated, watching the effect of his words as a\r\n",
      "gardener might watch the development of a bed of carefully tended\r\n",
      "asparagus.  \"I think the young gentleman has been before you and\r\n",

      "privilege of re-disclosing his revelation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Miss de Frey,\" broke in St. Michael, hurriedly, fearful lest his\r\n",

      "politics.  Twenty-four thousand a year, with prospects of more to\r\n",
      "come, and a charming place of her own not too far from town.  Quite\r\n",
      "the type of girl, too, who will make a good political hostess,\r\n",
      "brains without being brainy, you know.  Just the right thing.  Of\r\n",
      "course, it would be premature to make any definite announcement at\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"It would hardly be premature for my partner to announce what she\r\n",

      "own table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, is it me?  I beg your pardon.  I leave it,\" said Serena.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you.  No trumps,\" declared Lady Caroline.  The hand was\r\n",
      "successful, and the rubber ultimately fell to her with a\r\n",
      "comfortable margin of honours.  The same partners cut together\r\n",
      "again, and this time the cards went distinctly against Francesca\r\n",
      "and Ada Spelvexit, and a heavily piled-up score confronted them at\r\n",
      "the close of the rubber.  Francesca was conscious that a certain\r\n",
      "amount of rather erratic play on her part had at least contributed\r\n",
      "to the result.  St. Michael's incursion into the conversation had\r\n",
      "proved rather a powerful distraction to her ordinarily sound\r\n",
      "bridge-craft.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ada Spelvexit emptied her purse of several gold pieces and infused\r\n",
      "a corresponding degree of superiority into her manner.\r\n",

      "give an address to some charwomen afterwards.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why?\" asked Lady Caroline, with a disconcerting directness that\r\n",
      "was one of her most formidable characteristics.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, well, I have some things to say to them that I daresay they\r\n",
      "will like to hear,\" said Ada, with a thin laugh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "unbelief in any such probability.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I go about a good deal among working-class women,\" she added.\r\n",

      "painfully true it is that the poor have us always with them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ada Spelvexit hastened her departure; the marred impressiveness of\r\n",
      "her retreat came as a culminating discomfiture on the top of her\r\n",
      "ill-fortune at the card-table.  Possibly, however, the\r\n",
      "multiplication of her own annoyances enabled her to survey\r\n",
      "charwomen's troubles with increased cheerfulness.  None of them, at\r\n",
      "any rate, had spent an afternoon with Lady Caroline.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francesca cut in at another table and with better fortune attending\r\n",
      "on her, succeeded in winning back most of her losses.  A sense of\r\n",
      "satisfaction was distinctly dominant as she took leave of her\r\n",
      "hostess.  St. Michael's gossip, or rather the manner in which it\r\n",
      "had been received, had given her a clue to the real state of\r\n",
      "affairs, which, however slender and conjectural, at least pointed\r\n",
      "in the desired direction.  At first she had been horribly afraid\r\n",
      "lest she should be listening to a definite announcement which would\r\n",
      "have been the death-blow to her hopes, but as the recitation went\r\n",
      "on without any of those assured little minor details which St.\r\n",

      "It was a fresh rain-repentant afternoon, following a morning that\r\n",
      "had been sultry and torrentially wet by turns; the sort of\r\n",
      "afternoon that impels people to talk graciously of the rain as\r\n",
      "having done a lot of good, its chief merit in their eyes probably\r\n",
      "having been its recognition of the art of moderation.  Also it was\r\n",
      "an afternoon that invited bodily activity after the convalescent\r\n",
      "languor of the earlier part of the day.  Elaine had instinctively\r\n",
      "found her way into her riding-habit and sent an order down to the\r\n",
      "stables--a blessed oasis that still smelt sweetly of horse and hay\r\n",
      "and cleanliness in a world that reeked of petrol, and now she set\r\n",
      "her mare at a smart pace through a succession of long-stretching\r\n",
      "country lanes.  She was due some time that afternoon at a garden-\r\n",
      "party, but she rode with determination in an opposite direction.\r\n",
      "In the first place neither Comus or Courtenay would be at the\r\n",
      "party, which fact seemed to remove any valid reason that could be\r\n",
      "thought of for inviting her attendance thereat; in the second place\r\n",
      "about a hundred human beings would be gathered there, and human\r\n",
      "gatherings were not her most crying need at the present moment.\r\n",
      "Since her last encounter with her wooers, under the cedars in her\r\n",
      "own garden, Elaine realised that she was either very happy or\r\n",
      "cruelly unhappy, she could not quite determine which.  She seemed\r\n",
      "to have what she most wanted in the world lying at her feet, and\r\n",
      "she was dreadfully uncertain in her more reflective moments whether\r\n",
      "she really wanted to stretch out her hand and take it.  It was all\r\n",
      "very like some situation in an Arabian Nights tale or a story of\r\n",
      "Pagan Hellas, and consequently the more puzzling and disconcerting\r\n",
      "to a girl brought up on the methodical lines of Victorian\r\n",
      "Christianity.  Her appeal court was in permanent session these last\r\n",
      "few days, but it gave no decisions, at least none that she would\r\n",
      "listen to.  And the ride on her fast light-stepping little mare,\r\n",
      "alone and unattended, through the fresh-smelling leafy lanes into\r\n",
      "unexplored country, seemed just what she wanted at the moment.  The\r\n",
      "mare made some small delicate pretence of being roadshy, not the\r\n",
      "staring dolt-like kind of nervousness that shows itself in an\r\n",
      "irritating hanging-back as each conspicuous wayside object presents\r\n",
      "itself, but the nerve-flutter of an imaginative animal that merely\r\n",
      "results in a quick whisk of the head and a swifter bound forward.\r\n",
      "She might have paraphrased the mental attitude of the immortalised\r\n",

      "wider road that sloped steadily upward in a long stretch of hill\r\n",

      "yellow-painted vans, drawn for the most part by skewbald or\r\n",
      "speckled horses.  A certain rakish air about these oncoming road-\r\n",
      "craft proclaimed them as belonging to a travelling wild-beast show,\r\n",
      "decked out in the rich primitive colouring that one's taste in\r\n",
      "childhood would have insisted on before it had been schooled in the\r\n",
      "artistic value of dulness.  It was an unlooked-for and distinctly\r\n",
      "unwelcome encounter.  The mare had already commenced a sixfold\r\n",
      "scrutiny with nostrils, eyes and daintily-pricked ears; one ear\r\n",
      "made hurried little backward movements to hear what Elaine was\r\n",
      "saying about the eminent niceness and respectability of the\r\n",
      "approaching caravan, but even Elaine felt that she would be unable\r\n",
      "satisfactorily to explain the elephants and camels that would\r\n",
      "certainly form part of the procession.  To turn back would seem\r\n",
      "rather craven, and the mare might take fright at the manoeuvre and\r\n",
      "try to bolt; a gate standing ajar at the entrance to a farmyard\r\n",
      "lane provided a convenient way out of the difficulty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Elaine pushed her way through she became aware of a man standing\r\n",

      "for her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you.  I'm just getting out of the way of a wild-beast show,\"\r\n",
      "she explained; \"my mare is tolerant of motors and traction-engines,\r\n",
      "but I expect camels--hullo,\" she broke off, recognising the man as\r\n",
      "an old acquaintance, \"I heard you had taken rooms in a farmhouse\r\n",
      "somewhere.  Fancy meeting you in this way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the not very distant days of her little-girlhood, Tom Keriway\r\n",
      "had been a man to be looked upon with a certain awe and envy;\r\n",
      "indeed the glamour of his roving career would have fired the\r\n",
      "imagination, and wistful desire to do likewise, of many young\r\n",
      "Englishmen.  It seemed to be the grown-up realisation of the games\r\n",
      "played in dark rooms in winter fire-lit evenings, and the dreams\r\n",
      "dreamed over favourite books of adventure.  Making Vienna his\r\n",
      "headquarters, almost his home, he had rambled where he listed\r\n",
      "through the lands of the Near and Middle East as leisurely and\r\n",
      "thoroughly as tamer souls might explore Paris.  He had wandered\r\n",
      "through Hungarian horse-fairs, hunted shy crafty beasts on lonely\r\n",
      "Balkan hillsides, dropped himself pebble-wise into the stagnant\r\n",
      "human pool of some Bulgarian monastery, threaded his way through\r\n",
      "the strange racial mosaic of Salonika, listened with amused\r\n",
      "politeness to the shallow ultra-modern opinions of a voluble editor\r\n",
      "or lawyer in some wayside Russian town, or learned wisdom from a\r\n",
      "chance tavern companion, one of the atoms of the busy ant-stream of\r\n",
      "men and merchandise that moves untiringly round the shores of the\r\n",
      "Black Sea.  And far and wide as he might roam he always managed to\r\n",
      "turn up at frequent intervals, at ball and supper and theatre, in\r\n",
      "the gay Hauptstadt of the Habsburgs, haunting his favourite cafes\r\n",
      "and wine-vaults, skimming through his favourite news-sheets,\r\n",
      "greeting old acquaintances and friends, from ambassadors down to\r\n",
      "cobblers in the social scale.  He seldom talked of his travels, but\r\n",
      "it might be said that his travels talked of him; there was an air\r\n",
      "about him that a German diplomat once summed up in a phrase:  \"a\r\n",
      "man that wolves have sniffed at.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then two things happened, which he had not mapped out in his\r\n",
      "route; a severe illness shook half the life and all the energy out\r\n",
      "of him, and a heavy money loss brought him almost to the door of\r\n",
      "destitution.  With something, perhaps, of the impulse which drives\r\n",
      "a stricken animal away from its kind, Tom Keriway left the haunts\r\n",
      "where he had known so much happiness, and withdrew into the shelter\r\n",
      "of a secluded farmhouse lodging; more than ever he became to Elaine\r\n",
      "a hearsay personality.  And now the chance meeting with the caravan\r\n",
      "had flung her across the threshold of his retreat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What a charming little nook you've got hold of,\" she exclaimed\r\n",
      "with instinctive politeness, and then looked searchingly round, and\r\n",
      "discovered that she had spoken the truth; it really was charming.\r\n",
      "The farmhouse had that intensely English look that one seldom sees\r\n",
      "out of Normandy.  Over the whole scene of rickyard, garden,\r\n",
      "outbuildings, horsepond and orchard, brooded that air which seems\r\n",
      "rightfully to belong to out-of-the-way farmyards, an air of wakeful\r\n",
      "dreaminess which suggests that here, man and beast and bird have\r\n",
      "got up so early that the rest of the world has never caught them up\r\n",
      "and never will.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine dismounted, and Keriway led the mare round to a little\r\n",
      "paddock by the side of a great grey barn.  At the end of the lane\r\n",
      "they could see the show go past, a string of lumbering vans and\r\n",
      "great striding beasts that seemed to link the vast silences of the\r\n",
      "desert with the noises and sights and smells, the naphtha-flares\r\n",
      "and advertisement hoardings and trampled orange-peel, of an endless\r\n",
      "succession of towns.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You had better let the caravan pass well on its way before you get\r\n",
      "on the road again,\" said Keriway; \"the smell of the beasts may make\r\n",
      "your mare nervous and restive going home.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he called to a boy who was busy with a hoe among some\r\n",
      "defiantly prosperous weeds, to fetch the lady a glass of milk and a\r\n",
      "piece of currant loaf.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know when I've seen anything so utterly charming and\r\n",
      "peaceful,\" said Elaine, propping herself on a seat that a pear-tree\r\n",
      "had obligingly designed in the fantastic curve of its trunk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Charming, certainly,\" said Keriway, \"but too full of the stress of\r\n",
      "its own little life struggle to be peaceful.  Since I have lived\r\n",
      "here I've learnt, what I've always suspected, that a country\r\n",
      "farmhouse, set away in a world of its own, is one of the most\r\n",
      "wonderful studies of interwoven happenings and tragedies that can\r\n",
      "be imagined.  It is like the old chronicles of medieval Europe in\r\n",
      "the days when there was a sort of ordered anarchy between feudal\r\n",
      "lords and overlords, and burg-grafs, and mitred abbots, and prince-\r\n",
      "bishops, robber barons and merchant guilds, and Electors and so\r\n",
      "forth, all striving and contending and counter-plotting, and\r\n",
      "interfering with each other under some vague code of loosely-\r\n",
      "applied rules.  Here one sees it reproduced under one's eyes, like\r\n",
      "a musty page of black-letter come to life.  Look at one little\r\n",
      "section of it, the poultry-life on the farm.  Villa poultry, dull\r\n",
      "egg-machines, with records kept of how many ounces of food they\r\n",
      "eat, and how many pennyworths of eggs they lay, give you no idea of\r\n",
      "the wonder-life of these farm-birds; their feuds and jealousies,\r\n",
      "and carefully maintained prerogatives, their unsparing tyrannies\r\n",
      "and persecutions, their calculated courage and bravado or\r\n",
      "sedulously hidden cowardice, it might all be some human chapter\r\n",
      "from the annals of the old Rhineland or medieval Italy.  And then,\r\n",
      "outside their own bickering wars and hates, the grim enemies that\r\n",
      "come up against them from the woodlands; the hawk that dashes among\r\n",
      "the coops like a moss-trooper raiding the border, knowing well that\r\n",
      "a charge of shot may tear him to bits at any moment.  And the\r\n",
      "stoat, a creeping slip of brown fur a few inches long, intently and\r\n",
      "unstayably out for blood.  And the hunger-taught master of craft,\r\n",
      "the red fox, who has waited perhaps half the afternoon for his\r\n",
      "chance while the fowls were dusting themselves under the hedge, and\r\n",
      "just as they were turning supper-ward to the yard one has stopped a\r\n",
      "moment to give her feathers a final shake and found death springing\r\n",
      "upon her.  Do you know,\" he continued, as Elaine fed herself and\r\n",
      "the mare with morsels of currant-loaf, \"I don't think any tragedy\r\n",
      "in literature that I have ever come across impressed me so much as\r\n",
      "the first one, that I spelled out slowly for myself in words of\r\n",
      "three letters:  the bad fox has got the red hen.  There was\r\n",
      "something so dramatically complete about it; the badness of the\r\n",
      "fox, added to all the traditional guile of his race, seemed to\r\n",
      "heighten the horror of the hen's fate, and there was such a\r\n",
      "suggestion of masterful malice about the word 'got.'  One felt that\r\n",
      "a countryside in arms would not get that hen away from the bad fox.\r\n",
      "They used to think me a slow dull reader for not getting on with my\r\n",
      "lesson, but I used to sit and picture to myself the red hen, with\r\n",
      "its wings beating helplessly, screeching in terrified protest, or\r\n",
      "perhaps, if he had got it by the neck, with beak wide agape and\r\n",
      "silent, and eyes staring, as it left the farmyard for ever.  I have\r\n",
      "seen blood-spillings and down-crushings and abject defeat here and\r\n",
      "there in my time, but the red hen has remained in my mind as the\r\n",
      "type of helpless tragedy.\"  He was silent for a moment as if he\r\n",
      "were again musing over the three-letter drama that had so dwelt in\r\n",
      "his childhood's imagination.  \"Tell me some of the things you have\r\n",
      "seen in your time,\" was the request that was nearly on Elaine's\r\n",
      "lips, but she hastily checked herself and substituted another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tell me more about the farm, please.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he told her of a whole world, or rather of several intermingled\r\n",
      "worlds, set apart in this sleepy hollow in the hills, of beast lore\r\n",
      "and wood lore and farm craft, at times touching almost the border\r\n",
      "of witchcraft--passing lightly here, not with the probing eagerness\r\n",
      "of those who know nothing, but with the averted glance of those who\r\n",
      "fear to see too much.  He told her of those things that slept and\r\n",
      "those that prowled when the dusk fell, of strange hunting cats, of\r\n",
      "the yard swine and the stalled cattle, of the farm folk themselves,\r\n",
      "as curious and remote in their way, in their ideas and fears and\r\n",
      "wants and tragedies, as the brutes and feathered stock that they\r\n",
      "tended.  It seemed to Elaine as if a musty store of old-world\r\n",
      "children's books had been fetched down from some cobwebbed lumber-\r\n",
      "room and brought to life.  Sitting there in the little paddock,\r\n",
      "grown thickly with tall weeds and rank grasses, and shadowed by the\r\n",
      "weather-beaten old grey barn, listening to this chronicle of\r\n",
      "wonderful things, half fanciful, half very real, she could scarcely\r\n",
      "believe that a few miles away there was a garden-party in full\r\n",
      "swing, with smart frocks and smart conversation, fashionable\r\n",
      "refreshments and fashionable music, and a fevered undercurrent of\r\n",
      "social strivings and snubbings.  Did Vienna and the Balkan\r\n",
      "Mountains and the Black Sea seem as remote and hard to believe in,\r\n",
      "she wondered, to the man sitting by her side, who had discovered or\r\n",
      "invented this wonderful fairyland?  Was it a true and merciful\r\n",
      "arrangement of fate and life that the things of the moment thrust\r\n",
      "out the after-taste of the things that had been?  Here was one who\r\n",
      "had held much that was priceless in the hollow of his hand and lost\r\n",
      "it all, and he was happy and absorbed and well-content with the\r\n",
      "little wayside corner of the world into which he had crept.  And\r\n",
      "Elaine, who held so many desirable things in the hollow of her\r\n",
      "hand, could not make up her mind to be even moderately happy.  She\r\n",
      "did not even know whether to take this hero of her childhood down\r\n",
      "from his pedestal, or to place him on a higher one; on the whole\r\n",
      "she was inclined to resent rather than approve the idea that ill-\r\n",
      "health and misfortune could so completely subdue and tame an\r\n",
      "erstwhile bold and roving spirit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The mare was showing signs of delicately-hinted impatience; the\r\n",
      "paddock, with its teasing insects and very indifferent grazing, had\r\n",
      "not thrust out the image of her own comfortable well-foddered\r\n",
      "loose-box.  Elaine divested her habit of some remaining crumbs of\r\n",
      "bun-loaf and jumped lightly on to her saddle.  As she rode slowly\r\n",
      "down the lane, with Keriway escorting her as far as its gate, she\r\n",
      "looked round at what had seemed to her, a short while ago, just a\r\n",
      "picturesque old farmstead, a place of bee-hives and hollyhocks and\r\n",
      "gabled cart-sheds; now it was in her eyes a magic city, with an\r\n",
      "undercurrent of reality beneath its magic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are a person to be envied,\" she said to Keriway; \"you have\r\n",
      "created a fairyland, and you are living in it yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Envied?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He shot the question out with sudden bitterness.  She looked down\r\n",
      "and saw the wistful misery that had come into his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Once,\" he said to her, \"in a German paper I read a short story\r\n",
      "about a tame crippled crane that lived in the park of some small\r\n",
      "town.  I forget what happened in the story, but there was one line\r\n",

      "nearly taken the life of a stable-boy of whom he disapproved, but\r\n",
      "his strongest claims to distinction were his good looks and his\r\n",

      "course I don't agree with a word of it.  Your description of him\r\n",
      "building a hedge round the German cuckoo and hoping he was\r\n",
      "isolating it was rather sweet.  Seriously though, I regard him as\r\n",
      "one of the pillars of the Administration.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So do I,\" said Youghal; \"the misfortune is that he is merely\r\n",
      "propping up a canvas roof.  It's just his regrettable solidity and\r\n",
      "integrity that makes him so expensively dangerous.  The average\r\n",
      "Briton arrives at the same judgment about Roan's handling of\r\n",
      "foreign affairs as Omar does of the Supreme Being in his dealings\r\n",
      "with the world:  He's a good fellow and 'twill all be well.'\"\r\n",

      "stoutness passed by them on foot; \"I've seen him about a good deal\r\n",

      "popular all over Russia.  In the first three acts the heroine is\r\n",

      "delivered himself of loud, cheerful greetings. Joyeuse laid his\r\n",

      "side walk.  \"Ah, I have it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "trees of the Row a little drama in which he was directly interested\r\n",
      "was being played out not many hundred yards away.  Elaine and Comus\r\n",
      "were indulging themselves in two pennyworths of Park chair, drawn\r\n",
      "aside just a little from the serried rows of sitters who were set\r\n",
      "out like bedded plants over an acre or so of turf.  Comus was, for\r\n",
      "the moment, in a mood of pugnacious gaiety, disbursing a fund of\r\n",
      "pointed criticism and unsparing anecdote concerning those of the\r\n",
      "promenaders or loungers whom he knew personally or by sight.\r\n",
      "Elaine was rather quieter than usual, and the grave serenity of the\r\n",
      "Leonardo da Vinci portrait seemed intensified in her face this\r\n",
      "morning.  In his leisurely courtship Comus had relied almost\r\n",
      "exclusively on his physical attraction and the fitful drollery of\r\n",
      "his wit and high spirits, and these graces had gone far to make him\r\n",
      "seem a very desirable and rather lovable thing in Elaine's eyes.\r\n",
      "But he had left out of account the disfavour which he constantly\r\n",
      "risked and sometimes incurred from his frank and undisguised\r\n",
      "indifference to other people's interests and wishes, including, at\r\n",
      "times, Elaine's.  And the more that she felt that she liked him the\r\n",
      "more she was irritated by his lack of consideration for her.\r\n",
      "Without expecting that her every wish should become a law to him\r\n",
      "she would at least have liked it to reach the formality of a Second\r\n",
      "Reading.  Another important factor he had also left out of his\r\n",
      "reckoning, namely the presence on the scene of another suitor, who\r\n",
      "also had youth and wit to recommend him, and who certainly did not\r\n",
      "lack physical attractions.  Comus, marching carelessly through\r\n",
      "unknown country to effect what seemed already an assured victory,\r\n",
      "made the mistake of disregarding the existence of an unbeaten army\r\n",
      "on his flank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To-day Elaine felt that, without having actually quarrelled, she\r\n",
      "and Comus had drifted a little bit out of sympathy with one\r\n",
      "another.  The fault she knew was scarcely hers, in fact from the\r\n",
      "most good-natured point of view it could hardly be denied that it\r\n",
      "was almost entirely his.  The incident of the silver dish had\r\n",
      "lacked even the attraction of novelty; it had been one of a series,\r\n",
      "all bearing a strong connecting likeness.  There had been small\r\n",
      "unrepaid loans which Elaine would not have grudged in themselves,\r\n",
      "though the application for them brought a certain qualm of\r\n",
      "distaste; with the perversity which seemed inseparable from his\r\n",
      "doings, Comus had always flung away a portion of his borrowings in\r\n",
      "some ostentatious piece of glaring and utterly profitless\r\n",
      "extravagance, which outraged all the canons of her upbringing\r\n",
      "without bringing him an atom of understandable satisfaction.  Under\r\n",
      "these repeated discouragements it was not surprising that some\r\n",
      "small part of her affection should have slipped away, but she had\r\n",
      "come to the Park that morning with an unconfessed expectation of\r\n",
      "being gently wooed back to the mood of gracious forgetfulness that\r\n",
      "she was only too eager to assume.  It was almost worth while being\r\n",
      "angry with Comus for the sake of experiencing the pleasure of being\r\n",
      "coaxed into friendliness again with the charm which he knew so well\r\n",
      "how to exert.  It was delicious here under the trees on this\r\n",
      "perfect June morning, and Elaine had the blessed assurance that\r\n",
      "most of the women within range were envying her the companionship\r\n",
      "of the handsome merry-hearted youth who sat by her side.  With\r\n",
      "special complacence she contemplated her cousin Suzette, who was\r\n",
      "self-consciously but not very elatedly basking in the attentions of\r\n",
      "her fiance, an earnest-looking young man who was superintendent of\r\n",
      "a People's something-or-other on the south side of the river, and\r\n",
      "whose clothes Comus had described as having been made in Southwark\r\n",
      "rather than in anger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Most of the pleasures in life must be paid for, and the chair-\r\n",
      "ticket vendor in due time made his appearance in quest of pennies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Comus paid him from out of a varied assortment of coins and then\r\n",
      "balanced the remainder in the palm of his hand.  Elaine felt a\r\n",
      "sudden foreknowledge of something disagreeable about to happen and\r\n",
      "a red spot deepened in her cheeks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Four shillings and fivepence and a half-penny,\" said Comus,\r\n",
      "reflectively.  \"It's a ridiculous sum to last me for the next three\r\n",
      "days, and I owe a card debt of over two pounds.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes?\" commented Elaine dryly and with an apparent lack of interest\r\n",
      "in his exchequer statement.  Surely, she was thinking hurriedly to\r\n",
      "herself, he could not be foolish enough to broach the matter of\r\n",
      "another loan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The card debt is rather a nuisance,\" pursued Comus, with\r\n",
      "fatalistic persistency.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You won seven pounds last week, didn't you?\" asked Elaine; \"don't\r\n",
      "you put by any of your winnings to balance losses?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The four shillings and the fivepence and the half-penny represent\r\n",
      "the rearguard of the seven pounds,\" said Comus; \"the rest have\r\n",
      "fallen by the way.  If I can pay the two pounds to-day I daresay I\r\n",
      "shall win something more to go on with; I'm holding rather good\r\n",
      "cards just now.  But if I can't pay it of course I shan't show up\r\n",
      "at the club.  So you see the fix I am in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine took no notice of this indirect application.  The Appeal\r\n",
      "Court was assembling in haste to consider new evidence, and this\r\n",
      "time there was the rapidity of sudden determination about its\r\n",
      "movement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conversation strayed away from the fateful topic for a few\r\n",
      "moments and then Comus brought it deliberately back to the danger\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"It would be awfully nice if you would let me have a fiver for a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"If you are really bothered about your card debt I will send you\r\n",

      "quietly and with great decision.  \"And I shall not be at the\r\n",

      "His tactics would have been excellent if he had not forgotten that\r\n",
      "unbeaten army on his flank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine de Frey had known very clearly what qualities she had wanted\r\n",
      "in Comus, and she had known, against all efforts at self-deception,\r\n",
      "that he fell far short of those qualities.  She had been willing to\r\n",
      "lower her standard of moral requirements in proportion as she was\r\n",
      "fond of the boy, but there was a point beyond which she would not\r\n",
      "go.  He had hurt her pride besides alarming her sense of caution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suzette, on whom she felt a thoroughly justified tendency to look\r\n",
      "down, had at any rate an attentive and considerate lover.  Elaine\r\n",
      "walked towards the Park gates feeling that in one essential Suzette\r\n",
      "possessed something that had been denied to her, and at the gates\r\n",
      "she met Joyeuse and his spruce young rider preparing to turn\r\n",
      "homeward.\r\n",

      "The head waiter there is an old Viennese friend of mine and looks\r\n",
      "after me beautifully.  I've never been there with a lady before,\r\n",

      "engaged.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lunch was a success in every way.  There was just enough\r\n",
      "orchestral effort to immerse the conversation without drowning it,\r\n",
      "and Youghal was an attentive and inspired host.  Through an open\r\n",
      "doorway Elaine could see the cafe reading-room, with its imposing\r\n",
      "array of Neue Freie Presse, Berliner Tageblatt, and other exotic\r\n",
      "newspapers hanging on the wall.  She looked across at the young man\r\n",
      "seated opposite her, who gave one the impression of having centred\r\n",
      "the most serious efforts of his brain on his toilet and his food,\r\n",
      "and recalled some of the flattering remarks that the press had\r\n",
      "bestowed on his recent speeches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doesn't it make you conceited, Courtenay,\" she asked, \"to look at\r\n",

      "you would like to be a veiled Turkish woman for the rest of your\r\n",
      "life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to Ministers at question time and in debate, was showing himself\r\n",
      "equally well-informed on the subject of her culinary likes and\r\n",

      "The Rutland Galleries were crowded, especially in the neighbourhood\r\n",
      "of the tea-buffet, by a fashionable throng of art-patrons which had\r\n",
      "gathered to inspect Mervyn Quentock's collection of Society\r\n",
      "portraits.  Quentock was a young artist whose abilities were just\r\n",
      "receiving due recognition from the critics; that the recognition\r\n",
      "was not overdue he owed largely to his perception of the fact that\r\n",
      "if one hides one's talent under a bushel one must be careful to\r\n",
      "point out to everyone the exact bushel under which it is hidden.\r\n",
      "There are two manners of receiving recognition:  one is to be\r\n",
      "discovered so long after one's death that one's grandchildren have\r\n",
      "to write to the papers to establish their relationship; the other\r\n",
      "is to be discovered, like the infant Moses, at the very outset of\r\n",
      "one's career.  Mervyn Quentock had chosen the latter and happier\r\n",
      "manner.  In an age when many aspiring young men strive to advertise\r\n",
      "their wares by imparting to them a freakish imbecility, Quentock\r\n",
      "turned out work that was characterised by a pleasing delicate\r\n",
      "restraint, but he contrived to herald his output with a certain\r\n",
      "fanfare of personal eccentricity, thereby compelling an attention\r\n",
      "which might otherwise have strayed past his studio.  In appearance\r\n",
      "he was the ordinary cleanly young Englishman, except, perhaps, that\r\n",
      "his eyes rather suggested a library edition of the Arabian Nights;\r\n",
      "his clothes matched his appearance and showed no taint of the\r\n",
      "sartorial disorder by which the bourgeois of the garden-city and\r\n",
      "the Latin Quarter anxiously seeks to proclaim his kinship with art\r\n",
      "and thought.  His eccentricity took the form of flying in the face\r\n",
      "of some of the prevailing social currents of the day, but as a\r\n",
      "reactionary, never as a reformer.  He produced a gasp of admiring\r\n",
      "astonishment in fashionable circles by refusing to paint actresses-\r\n",
      "-except, of course, those who had left the legitimate drama to\r\n",
      "appear between the boards of Debrett.  He absolutely declined to\r\n",
      "execute portraits of Americans unless they hailed from certain\r\n",
      "favoured States.  His \"water-colour-line,\" as a New York paper\r\n",
      "phrased it, earned for him a crop of angry criticisms and a shoal\r\n",

      "bygone feeling of good fellowship had been stamped out was, he\r\n",
      "knew, probably in great part his own doing, and it was possible\r\n",
      "that the old friendliness was still there under the surface of\r\n",
      "things, ready to show itself again if he willed it, and friends\r\n",
      "were becoming scarcer with him than enemies in these days.  Looking\r\n",
      "at the picture with its wistful hint of a long ago comradeship,\r\n",

      "on their earlier footing, and to see again on his mother's face the\r\n",
      "look that the artist had caught and perpetuated in its momentary\r\n",
      "flitting.  If the projected Elaine-marriage came off, and in spite\r\n",
      "of recent maladroit behaviour on his part he still counted it an\r\n",
      "assured thing, much of the immediate cause for estrangement between\r\n",
      "himself and his mother would be removed, or at any rate, easily\r\n",
      "removable.  With the influence of Elaine's money behind him he\r\n",
      "promised himself that he would find some occupation that would\r\n",
      "remove from himself the reproach of being a waster and idler.\r\n",
      "There were lots of careers, he told himself, that were open to a\r\n",
      "man with solid financial backing and good connections.  There might\r\n",
      "yet be jolly times ahead, in which his mother would have her share\r\n",
      "of the good things that were going, and carking thin-lipped Henry\r\n",
      "Greech and other of Comus's detractors could take their sour looks\r\n",

      "as though he were studying its every detail, and seeing really only\r\n",

      "After the momentous lunch at the Corridor Restaurant Elaine had\r\n",
      "returned to Manchester Square (where she was staying with one of\r\n",
      "her numerous aunts) in a frame of mind that embraced a tangle of\r\n",
      "competing emotions.  In the first place she was conscious of a\r\n",
      "dominant feeling of relief; in a moment of impetuosity, not wholly\r\n",
      "uninfluenced by pique, she had settled the problem which hours of\r\n",
      "hard thinking and serious heart-searching had brought no nearer to\r\n",
      "solution, and, although she felt just a little inclined to be\r\n",
      "scared at the headlong manner of her final decision, she had now\r\n",
      "very little doubt in her own mind that the decision had been the\r\n",
      "right one.  In fact the wonder seemed rather that she should have\r\n",
      "been so long in doubt as to which of her wooers really enjoyed her\r\n",
      "honest approval.  She had been in love, these many weeks past with\r\n",
      "an imaginary Comus, but now that she had definitely walked out of\r\n",
      "her dreamland she saw that nearly all the qualities that had\r\n",
      "appealed to her on his behalf had been absent from, or only\r\n",
      "fitfully present in, the character of the real Comus.  And now that\r\n",
      "she had installed Youghal in the first place of her affections he\r\n",
      "had rapidly acquired in her eyes some of the qualities which ranked\r\n",
      "highest in her estimation.  Like the proverbial buyer she had the\r\n",
      "happy feminine tendency of magnifying the worth of her possession\r\n",
      "as soon as she had acquired it.  And Courtenay Youghal gave Elaine\r\n",
      "some justification for her sense of having chosen wisely.  Above\r\n",
      "all other things, selfish and cynical though he might appear at\r\n",
      "times, he was unfailingly courteous and considerate towards her.\r\n",
      "That was a circumstance which would always have carried weight with\r\n",
      "her in judging any man; in this case its value was enormously\r\n",
      "heightened by contrast with the behaviour of her other wooer.  And\r\n",
      "Youghal had in her eyes the advantage which the glamour of combat,\r\n",
      "even the combat of words and wire-pulling, throws over the fighter.\r\n",
      "He stood well in the forefront of a battle which however carefully\r\n",
      "stage-managed, however honeycombed with personal insincerities and\r\n",
      "overlaid with calculated mock-heroics, really meant something,\r\n",
      "really counted for good or wrong in the nation's development and\r\n",
      "the world's history.  Shrewd parliamentary observers might have\r\n",
      "warned her that Youghal would never stand much higher in the\r\n",
      "political world than he did at present, as a brilliant Opposition\r\n",
      "freelance, leading lively and rather meaningless forays against the\r\n",
      "dull and rather purposeless foreign policy of a Government that was\r\n",
      "scarcely either to be blamed for or congratulated on its handling\r\n",
      "of foreign affairs.  The young politician had not the strength of\r\n",
      "character or convictions that keeps a man naturally in the\r\n",
      "forefront of affairs and gives his counsels a sterling value, and\r\n",
      "on the other hand his insincerity was not deep enough to allow him\r\n",
      "to pose artificially and successfully as a leader of men and shaper\r\n",
      "of movements.  For the moment, however, his place in public life\r\n",
      "was sufficiently marked out to give him a secure footing in that\r\n",
      "world where people are counted individually and not in herds.  The\r\n",
      "woman whom he would make his wife would have the chance, too, if\r\n",

      "in moments of emergency.  She found a certain satisfaction in\r\n",
      "scrupulously observing her promise, made earlier on that eventful\r\n",
      "day, and sent off a messenger with the stipulated loan.  Then a\r\n",
      "reaction of compunction set in, and she reminded herself that in\r\n",
      "fairness she ought to write and tell her news in as friendly a\r\n",
      "fashion as possible to her dismissed suitor before it burst upon\r\n",
      "him from some other quarter.  They had parted on more or less\r\n",
      "quarrelling terms it was true, but neither of them had foreseen the\r\n",
      "finality of the parting nor the permanence of the breach between\r\n",
      "them; Comus might even now be thinking himself half-forgiven, and\r\n",

      "would have been sincerely regretted by the other, but any minor\r\n",
      "discomfiture would have produced a feeling very much akin to\r\n",

      "gas-lit mission-halls, wet umbrellas, and discreet applause seemed\r\n",
      "to accompany him everywhere.  He was an exponent, among other\r\n",
      "things, of what he called New Thought, which seemed to lend itself\r\n",
      "conveniently to the employment of a good deal of rather stale\r\n",
      "phraseology.  Probably in the course of some thirty odd years of\r\n",
      "existence he had never been of any notable use to man, woman, child\r\n",

      "whose calamities one can escape at any moment by the simple process\r\n",

      "The old anxiety as to her precarious tenure of her present quarters\r\n",
      "put on again all its familiar terrors.  One day, she foresaw, in\r\n",
      "the horribly near future, George St. Michael would come pattering\r\n",
      "up her stairs with the breathless intelligence that Emmeline\r\n",
      "Chetrof was going to marry somebody or other in the Guards or the\r\n",
      "Record Office as the case might be, and then there would be an\r\n",

      "wandering forth to some cheap unhappy far-off dwelling, where the\r\n",
      "stately Van der Meulen and its companion host of beautiful and\r\n",
      "desirable things would be stuffed and stowed away in soulless\r\n",
      "surroundings, like courtly emigres fallen on evil days.  It was\r\n",
      "unthinkable, but the trouble was that it had to be thought about.\r\n",
      "And if Comus had played his cards well and transformed himself from\r\n",
      "an encumbrance into a son with wealth at his command, the tragedy\r\n",
      "which she saw looming in front of her might have been avoided or at\r\n",
      "the worst whittled down to easily bearable proportions.  With money\r\n",
      "behind one, the problem of where to live approaches more nearly to\r\n",
      "the simple question of where do you wish to live, and a rich\r\n",
      "daughter-in-law would have surely seen to it that she did not have\r\n",
      "to leave her square mile of Mecca and go out into the wilderness of\r\n",

      "compounded for there were other desirable residences which would\r\n",
      "have been capable of consoling Francesca for her lost Eden.  And\r\n",
      "now the detested Courtenay Youghal, with his mocking eyes and air\r\n",
      "of youthful cynicism, had stepped in and overthrown those golden\r\n",
      "hopes and plans whose non-fulfilment would make such a world of\r\n",
      "change in her future.  Assuredly she had reason to feel bitter\r\n",
      "against that young man, and she was not disposed to take a very\r\n",
      "lenient view of Comus's own mismanagement of the affair; her\r\n",

      "of good luck that had seemed about to fall into their laps had been\r\n",
      "thrust aside by an act or series of acts of wanton paltry folly.\r\n",
      "The good ship had been lost for the sake of the traditional\r\n",
      "ha'porth of tar.  Comus had paid some pressing tailor's or\r\n",
      "tobacconist's bill with a loan unwillingly put at his disposal by\r\n",
      "the girl he was courting, and had flung away his chances of\r\n",
      "securing a wealthy and in every way desirable bride.  Elaine de\r\n",
      "Frey and her fortune might have been the making of Comus, but he\r\n",
      "had hurried in as usual to effect his own undoing.  Calmness did\r\n",
      "not in this case come with reflection; the more Francesca thought\r\n",
      "about the matter, the more exasperated she grew.  Comus threw\r\n",
      "himself down in a low chair and watched her without a trace of\r\n",
      "embarrassment or concern at her mortification.  He had come to her\r\n",
      "feeling rather sorry for himself, and bitterly conscious of his\r\n",
      "defeat, and she had met him with a taunt and without the least hint\r\n",
      "of sympathy; he determined that she should be tantalised with the\r\n",
      "knowledge of how small and stupid a thing had stood between the\r\n",
      "realisation and ruin of her hopes for him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "tears of vexation that stood in her eyes, she looked across at the\r\n",
      "handsome boy who sat opposite her, mocking at his own misfortune,\r\n",

      "to its consequences.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Comus,\" she said quietly and wearily, \"you are an exact reversal\r\n",

      "advantages that a boy could want to help him on in the world, and\r\n",

      "For the moment there was a flush of sympathy and something like\r\n",
      "outspoken affection between mother and son.  They seemed very much\r\n",
      "alone in the world just now, and in the general overturn of hopes\r\n",
      "and plans, there flickered a chance that each might stretch out a\r\n",
      "hand to the other, and summon back to their lives an old dead love\r\n",
      "that was the best and strongest feeling either of them had known.\r\n",
      "But the sting of disappointment was too keen, and the flood of\r\n",
      "resentment mounted too high on either side to allow the chance more\r\n",
      "than a moment in which to flicker away into nothingness.  The old\r\n",
      "fatal topic of estrangement came to the fore, the question of\r\n",
      "immediate ways and means, and mother and son faced themselves again\r\n",
      "as antagonists on a well-disputed field.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is done is done,\" said Francesca, with a movement of tragic\r\n",
      "impatience that belied the philosophy of her words; \"there is\r\n",
      "nothing to be gained by crying over spilt milk.  There is the\r\n",
      "present and the future to be thought about, though.  One can't go\r\n",
      "on indefinitely as a tenant-for-life in a fools' paradise.\"  Then\r\n",
      "she pulled herself together and proceeded to deliver an ultimatum\r\n",

      "\"It's not much use talking to you about money, as I know from long\r\n",

      "Season I'm already obliged to be thinking of leaving Town.  And\r\n",
      "you, I'm afraid, will have to be thinking of leaving England at\r\n",

      "something better for yourself from the financial point of view, and\r\n",
      "you've thrown it away for the sake of borrowing a little ready\r\n",
      "money for your luxuries, so now you must take what you can get.\r\n",
      "The pay won't be very good at first, but living is not dear out\r\n",
      "there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"West Africa,\" said Comus, reflectively; \"it's a sort of modern\r\n",

      "for tiresome people.  Dear Uncle Henry may talk lugubriously about\r\n",

      "wasting your time in the West End, other people have been grappling\r\n",
      "with the study of tropical diseases, and the West African coast\r\n",

      "sanatorium.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "Psalms and even more of a company prospectus.  If you were honest\r\n",
      "you'd confess that you lifted it straight out of a rubber or\r\n",
      "railway promotion scheme.  Seriously, mother, if I must grub about\r\n",
      "for a living, why can't I do it in England?  I could go into a\r\n",
      "brewery for instance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Francesca shook her head decisively; she could foresee the sort of\r\n",
      "steady work Comus was likely to accomplish, with the lodestone of\r\n",
      "Town and the minor attractions of race-meetings and similar\r\n",
      "festivities always beckoning to him from a conveniently attainable\r\n",
      "distance, but apart from that aspect of the case there was a\r\n",
      "financial obstacle in the way of his obtaining any employment at\r\n",
      "home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Breweries and all those sort of things necessitate money to start\r\n",
      "with; one has to pay premiums or invest capital in the undertaking,\r\n",
      "and so forth.  And as we have no money available, and can scarcely\r\n",
      "pay our debts as it is, it's no use thinking about it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can't we sell something?\" asked Comus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He made no actual suggestion as to what should be sacrificed, but\r\n",
      "he was looking straight at the Van der Meulen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment Francesca felt a stifling sensation of weakness, as\r\n",
      "though her heart was going to stop beating.  Then she sat forward\r\n",
      "in her chair and spoke with energy, almost fierceness.\r\n",

      "\"When I am dead my things can be sold and dispersed.  As long as I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In her holy place, with all her treasured possessions around her,\r\n",
      "this dreadful suggestion had been made.  Some of her cherished\r\n",
      "household gods, souvenirs and keepsakes from past days, would,\r\n",
      "perhaps, not have fetched a very considerable sum in the auction-\r\n",
      "room, others had a distinct value of their own, but to her they\r\n",
      "were all precious.  And the Van der Meulen, at which Comus had\r\n",
      "looked with impious appraising eyes, was the most sacred of them\r\n",
      "all.  When Francesca had been away from her Town residence or had\r\n",
      "been confined to her bedroom through illness, the great picture\r\n",
      "with its stately solemn representation of a long-ago battle-scene,\r\n",
      "painted to flatter the flattery-loving soul of a warrior-king who\r\n",
      "was dignified even in his campaigns--this was the first thing she\r\n",
      "visited on her return to Town or convalescence.  If an alarm of\r\n",
      "fire had been raised it would have been the first thing for whose\r\n",
      "safety she would have troubled.  And Comus had almost suggested\r\n",
      "that it should be parted with, as one sold railway shares and other\r\n",
      "soulless things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scolding, she had long ago realised, was a useless waste of time\r\n",
      "and energy where Comus was concerned, but this evening she unloosed\r\n",
      "her tongue for the mere relief that it gave to her surcharged\r\n",
      "feelings.  He sat listening without comment, though she purposely\r\n",
      "let fall remarks that she hoped might sting him into self-defence\r\n",
      "or protest.  It was an unsparing indictment, the more damaging in\r\n",
      "that it was so irrefutably true, the more tragic in that it came\r\n",
      "from perhaps the one person in the world whose opinion he had ever\r\n",
      "cared for.  And he sat through it as silent and seemingly unmoved\r\n",
      "as though she had been rehearsing a speech for some drawing-room\r\n",
      "comedy.  When she had had her say his method of retort was not the\r\n",
      "soft answer that turneth away wrath but the inconsequent one that\r\n",

      "there was nothing more to be said.  Any attempt at ignoring the\r\n",
      "situation, and passing on to less controversial topics would have\r\n",
      "been a mockery and pretence which neither of them would have\r\n",
      "troubled to sustain.  So the meal went forward with its dragged-out\r\n",
      "dreary intimacy of two people who were separated by a gulf of\r\n",

      "optimistic enough to prophesy smooth things of the future that lay\r\n",
      "beyond that span.  Of the fourth act, with its carefully held back\r\n",
      "but obviously imminent reconciliation between the leading\r\n",

      "friendliness uppermost in her mind; even the sight of Elaine de\r\n",
      "Frey and Courtenay Youghal leaving the theatre together did not\r\n",

      "farewell in it.  His own particular friends were unrepresented.\r\n",

      "travels and experiences in those regions probably did not cover\r\n",
      "much ground or stretch over any great length of time, but he was\r\n",
      "one of those individuals who can describe a continent on the\r\n",
      "strength of a few days' stay in a coast town as intimately and\r\n",
      "dogmatically as a paleontologist will reconstruct an extinct mammal\r\n",
      "from the evidence of a stray shin bone.  He had the loud\r\n",

      "can do no listening in the ordinary way and whose eyes have to\r\n",
      "perform the function of listening for him.  His vanity did not\r\n",

      "in his society, and his need for a wide field of audience and\r\n",
      "admiration was mercifully calculated to spread his operations over\r\n",
      "a considerable human area.  Moreover, his craving for attentive\r\n",
      "listeners forced him to interest himself in a wonderful variety of\r\n",
      "subjects on which he was able to discourse fluently and with a\r\n",
      "certain semblance of special knowledge.  Politics he avoided; the\r\n",
      "ground was too well known, and there was a definite no to every\r\n",
      "definite yes that could be put forward.  Moreover, argument was not\r\n",

      "With the exception of Henry Greech, whose feelings towards his\r\n",

      "merriment of a cynical and amused onlooker than of one who responds\r\n",
      "to the gaiety of his companions.  Sometimes he laughed quietly to\r\n",
      "himself at some chance remark of a scarcely mirth-provoking nature,\r\n",
      "and Lady Veula, watching him narrowly, came to the conclusion that\r\n",
      "an element of fear was blended with his seemingly buoyant spirits.\r\n",
      "Once or twice he caught her eye across the table, and a certain\r\n",
      "sympathy seemed to grow up between them, as though they were both\r\n",

      "crowded board beneath it.  The picture itself was scarcely damaged,\r\n",

      "it was found that a liqueur glass, one out of a set of seven that\r\n",
      "would be impossible to match, had been shivered into fragments.\r\n",
      "Francesca's almost motherly love for her possessions made her\r\n",
      "peculiarly sensible to a feeling of annoyance and depression at the\r\n",
      "accident, but she turned politely to listen to Mrs. Greech's\r\n",

      "practical sympathy, was telling Francesca two good ways for getting\r\n",
      "wine stains out of tablecloths.  The smaller economies of life were\r\n",
      "an unnecessary branch of learning for Mrs. Greech, but she studied\r\n",

      "Francesca did not renew her speech-making; a chill seemed to have\r\n",
      "fallen over all efforts at festivity, and she contented herself\r\n",
      "with refilling her glass and simply drinking to her boy's good\r\n",
      "health.  The others followed her example, and Comus drained his\r\n",
      "glass with a brief \"thank you all very much.\"  The sense of\r\n",
      "constraint which hung over the company was not, however, marked by\r\n",
      "any uncomfortable pause in the conversation.  Henry Greech was a\r\n",
      "fluent thinker, of the kind that prefer to do their thinking aloud;\r\n",

      "Commons was an official livery of which he divested himself as\r\n",

      "first opportunity of launching himself into a flow of satirical\r\n",

      "to this sort of thing in her own home circle, and sat listening\r\n",
      "with the stoical indifference with which an Esquimau might accept\r\n",
      "the occurrence of one snowstorm the more, in the course of an\r\n",
      "Arctic winter.  Serena Golackly felt a certain relief at the fact\r\n",
      "that her imported guest was not, after all, monopolising the\r\n",

      "M.P.  Henry Greech paused for an instant to chuckle at one of his\r\n",

      "anticipations of an ultimate auspicious return.  Even Henry Greech\r\n",
      "sank his personal dislike of the boy for the moment, and made\r\n",
      "hearty jocular allusions to a home-coming, which, in the elder\r\n",
      "man's eyes, seemed possibly pleasantly remote.  Lady Veula alone\r\n",
      "made no reference to the future; she simply said, \"Good-bye,\r\n",

      "would miss, for a little while at any rate, the high-spirited boy\r\n",
      "who could be so attractive in his better moods.  Her impulse, after\r\n",

      "an undying flow of Teutonic small talk rattled and jangled across\r\n",
      "the intervening stretch of carpet.  \"Not one of those three women\r\n",
      "has ceased talking for an instant since we've been sitting here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They will presently, if only for a moment,\" said Courtenay; \"when\r\n",
      "the dish you have ordered comes in there will be a deathly silence\r\n",
      "at the next table.  No German can see a plat brought in for someone\r\n",
      "else without being possessed with a great fear that it represents a\r\n",
      "more toothsome morsel or a better money's worth than what he has\r\n",
      "ordered for himself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The exuberant Teutonic chatter was balanced on the other side of\r\n",
      "the room by an even more penetrating conversation unflaggingly\r\n",
      "maintained by a party of Americans, who were sitting in judgment on\r\n",
      "the cuisine of the country they were passing through, and finding\r\n",
      "few extenuating circumstances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What Mr. Lonkins wants is a real DEEP cherry pie,\" announced a\r\n",
      "lady in a tone of dramatic and honest conviction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, yes, that is so,\" corroborated a gentleman who was apparently\r\n",
      "the Mr. Lonkins in question; \"a real DEEP cherry pie.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We had the same trouble way back in Paris,\" proclaimed another\r\n",
      "lady; \"little Jerome and the girls don't want to eat any more creme\r\n",
      "renversee.  I'd give anything if they could get some real cherry\r\n",
      "pie.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Real DEEP cherry pie,\" assented Mr. Lonkins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Way down in Ohio we used to have peach pie that was real good,\"\r\n",
      "said Mrs. Lonkins, turning on a tap of reminiscence that presently\r\n",
      "flowed to a cascade.  The subject of pies seemed to lend itself to\r\n",
      "indefinite expansion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do those people think of nothing but their food?\" asked Elaine, as\r\n",
      "the virtues of roasted mutton suddenly came to the fore and\r\n",
      "received emphatic recognition, even the absent and youthful Jerome\r\n",
      "being quoted in its favour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the contrary,\" said Courtenay, \"they are a widely-travelled\r\n",
      "set, and the man has had a notably interesting career.  It is a\r\n",
      "form of home-sickness with them to discuss and lament the cookery\r\n",
      "and foods that they've never had the leisure to stay at home and\r\n",
      "digest.  The Wandering Jew probably babbled unremittingly about\r\n",
      "some breakfast dish that took so long to prepare that he had never\r\n",
      "time to eat it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A waiter deposited a dish of Wiener Nierenbraten in front of\r\n",
      "Elaine.  At the same moment a magic hush fell upon the three German\r\n",
      "ladies at the adjoining table, and the flicker of a great fear\r\n",
      "passed across their eyes.  Then they burst forth again into\r\n",
      "tumultuous chatter.  Courtenay had proved a reliable prophet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost at the same moment as the luncheon-dish appeared on the\r\n",
      "scene, two ladies arrived at a neighbouring table, and bowed with\r\n",
      "dignified cordiality to Elaine and Courtenay.  They were two of the\r\n",
      "more worldly and travelled of Elaine's extensive stock of aunts,\r\n",
      "and they happened to be making a short stay at the same hotel as\r\n",
      "the young couple.  They were far too correct and rationally minded\r\n",
      "to intrude themselves on their niece, but it was significant of\r\n",
      "Elaine's altered view as to the sanctity of honeymoon life that she\r\n",
      "secretly rather welcomed the presence of her two relatives in the\r\n",
      "hotel, and had found time and occasion to give them more of her\r\n",
      "society than she would have considered necessary or desirable a few\r\n",
      "weeks ago.  The younger of the two she rather liked, in a\r\n",
      "restrained fashion, as one likes an unpretentious watering-place or\r\n",
      "a restaurant that does not try to give one a musical education in\r\n",
      "addition to one's dinner.  One felt instinctively about her that\r\n",
      "she would never wear rather more valuable diamonds than any other\r\n",
      "woman in the room, and would never be the only person to be saved\r\n",
      "in a steamboat disaster or hotel fire.  As a child she might have\r\n",
      "been perfectly well able to recite \"On Linden when the sun was\r\n",
      "low,\" but one felt certain that nothing ever induced her to do so.\r\n",
      "The elder aunt, Mrs. Goldbrook, did not share her sister's\r\n",
      "character as a human rest-cure; most people found her rather\r\n",
      "disturbing, chiefly, perhaps, from her habit of asking unimportant\r\n",
      "questions with enormous solemnity.  Her manner of enquiring after a\r\n",
      "trifling ailment gave one the impression that she was more\r\n",
      "concerned with the fortunes of the malady than with oneself, and\r\n",
      "when one got rid of a cold one felt that she almost expected to be\r\n",
      "given its postal address.  Probably her manner was merely the\r\n",
      "defensive outwork of an innate shyness, but she was not a woman who\r\n",
      "commanded confidences.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A telephone call for Courtenay,\" commented the younger of the two\r\n",
      "women as Youghal hurriedly flashed through the room; \"the telephone\r\n",
      "system seems to enter very largely into that young man's life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The telephone has robbed matrimony of most of its sting,\" said the\r\n",
      "elder; \"so much more discreet than pen and ink communications which\r\n",
      "get read by the wrong people.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine's aunts were conscientiously worldly; they were the natural\r\n",
      "outcome of a stock that had been conscientiously straight-laced for\r\n",
      "many generations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine had progressed to the pancake stage before Courtenay\r\n",
      "returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sorry to be away so long,\" he said, \"but I've arranged something\r\n",
      "rather nice for to-night.  There's rather a jolly masquerade ball\r\n",
      "on.  I've 'phoned about getting a costume for you and it's alright.\r\n",
      "It will suit you beautifully, and I've got my harlequin dress with\r\n",
      "me.  Madame Kelnicort, excellent soul, is going to chaperone you,\r\n",
      "and she'll take you back any time you like; I'm quite unreliable\r\n",
      "when I get into fancy dress.  I shall probably keep going till some\r\n",
      "unearthly hour of the morning.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A masquerade ball in a strange city hardly represented Elaine's\r\n",
      "idea of enjoyment.  Carefully to disguise one's identity in a\r\n",
      "neighbourhood where one was entirely unknown seemed to her rather\r\n",
      "meaningless.  With Courtenay, of course, it was different; he\r\n",
      "seemed to have friends and acquaintances everywhere.  However, the\r\n",
      "matter had progressed to a point which would have made a refusal to\r\n",
      "go seem rather ungracious.  Elaine finished her pancake and began\r\n",
      "to take a polite interest in her costume.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is your character?\" asked Madame Kelnicort that evening, as\r\n",
      "they uncloaked, preparatory to entering the already crowded ball-\r\n",
      "room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I believe I'm supposed to represent Marjolaine de Montfort,\r\n",
      "whoever she may have been,\" said Elaine.  \"Courtenay declares he\r\n",
      "only wanted to marry me because I'm his ideal of her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what a mistake to go as a character you know nothing about.\r\n",
      "To enjoy a masquerade ball you ought to throw away your own self\r\n",
      "and be the character you represent.  Now Courtenay has been\r\n",
      "Harlequin since half-way through dinner; I could see it dancing in\r\n",
      "his eyes.  At about six o'clock to-morrow morning he will fall\r\n",
      "asleep and wake up a member of the British House of Parliament on\r\n",
      "his honeymoon, but to-night he is unrestrainedly Harlequin.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine stood in the ball-room surrounded by a laughing jostling\r\n",
      "throng of pierrots, jockeys, Dresden-china shepherdesses, Roumanian\r\n",
      "peasant-girls and all the lively make-believe creatures that form\r\n",
      "the ingredients of a fancy-dress ball.  As she stood watching them\r\n",
      "she experienced a growing feeling of annoyance, chiefly with\r\n",
      "herself.  She was assisting, as the French say, at one of the\r\n",
      "gayest scenes of Europe's gayest capital, and she was conscious of\r\n",
      "being absolutely unaffected by the gaiety around her.  The costumes\r\n",
      "were certainly interesting to look at, and the music good to listen\r\n",
      "to, and to that extent she was amused, but the ABANDON of the scene\r\n",
      "made no appeal to her.  It was like watching a game of which you\r\n",
      "did not know the rules, and in the issue of which you were not\r\n",
      "interested.  Elaine began to wonder what was the earliest moment at\r\n",
      "which she could drag Madame Kelnicort away from the revel without\r\n",
      "being guilty of sheer cruelty.  Then Courtenay wriggled out of the\r\n",
      "crush and came towards her, a joyous laughing Courtenay, looking\r\n",
      "younger and handsomer than she had ever seen him.  She could\r\n",
      "scarcely recognise in him to-night the rising young debater who\r\n",
      "made embarrassing onslaughts on the Government's foreign policy\r\n",
      "before a crowded House of Commons.  He claimed her for the dance\r\n",
      "that was just starting, and steered her dexterously into the heart\r\n",
      "of the waltzing crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You look more like Marjolaine than I should have thought a mortal\r\n",
      "woman of these days could look,\" he declared, \"only Marjolaine did\r\n",
      "smile sometimes.  You have rather the air of wondering if you'd\r\n",
      "left out enough tea for the servants' breakfast.  Don't mind my\r\n",
      "teasing; I love you to look like that, and besides, it makes a\r\n",
      "splendid foil to my Harlequin--my selfishness coming to the fore\r\n",
      "again, you see.  But you really are to go home the moment you're\r\n",
      "bored; the excellent Kelnicort gets heaps of dances throughout the\r\n",
      "winter, so don't mind sacrificing her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little later in the evening Elaine found herself standing out a\r\n",
      "dance with a grave young gentleman from the Russian Embassy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Monsieur Courtenay enjoys himself, doesn't he?\" he observed, as\r\n",
      "the youthful-looking harlequin flashed past them, looking like some\r\n",
      "restless gorgeous-hued dragonfly; \"why is it that the good God has\r\n",
      "given your countrymen the boon of eternal youth?  Some of your\r\n",
      "countrywomen, too, but all of the men.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine could think of many of her countrymen who were not and never\r\n",
      "could have been youthful, but as far as Courtenay was concerned she\r\n",
      "recognised the fitness of the remark.  And the recognition carried\r\n",
      "with it a sense of depression.  Would he always remain youthful and\r\n",
      "keen on gaiety and revelling while she grew staid and retiring?\r\n",
      "She had thrust the lively intractable Comus out of her mind, as by\r\n",
      "his perverseness he had thrust himself out of her heart, and she\r\n",
      "had chosen the brilliant young man of affairs as her husband.  He\r\n",
      "had honestly let her see the selfish side of his character while he\r\n",
      "was courting her, but she had been prepared to make due sacrifices\r\n",
      "to the selfishness of a public man who had his career to consider\r\n",
      "above all other things.  Would she also have to make sacrifices to\r\n",
      "the harlequin spirit which was now revealing itself as an\r\n",
      "undercurrent in his nature?  When one has inured oneself to the\r\n",
      "idea of a particular form of victimisation it is disconcerting to\r\n",
      "be confronted with another.  Many a man who would patiently undergo\r\n",
      "martyrdom for religion's sake would be furiously unwilling to be a\r\n",
      "martyr to neuralgia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think that is why you English love animals so much,\" pursued the\r\n",
      "young diplomat; \"you are such splendid animals yourselves.  You are\r\n",
      "lively because you want to be lively, not because people are\r\n",
      "looking on at you.  Monsieur Courtenay is certainly an animal.  I\r\n",
      "mean it as a high compliment.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Am I an animal?\" asked Elaine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was going to say you are an angel,\" said the Russian, in some\r\n",
      "embarrassment, \"but I do not think that would do; angels and\r\n",
      "animals would never get on together.  To get on with animals you\r\n",
      "must have a sense of humour, and I don't suppose angels have any\r\n",
      "sense of humour; you see it would be no use to them as they never\r\n",
      "hear any jokes.\"\r\n",

      "to Leonardo da Vinci.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Evidently the impression she made on people was solely one of\r\n",
      "externals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was that how Courtenay regarded her?  Was that to be her function\r\n",
      "and place in life, a painted background, a decorative setting to\r\n",
      "other people's triumphs and tragedies?  Somehow to-night she had\r\n",
      "the feeling that a general might have who brought imposing forces\r\n",
      "into the field and could do nothing with them.  She possessed youth\r\n",
      "and good looks, considerable wealth, and had just made what would\r\n",
      "be thought by most people a very satisfactory marriage.  And\r\n",
      "already she seemed to be standing aside as an onlooker where she\r\n",
      "had expected herself to be taking a leading part.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Does this sort of thing appeal to you?\" she asked the young\r\n",
      "Russian, nodding towards the gay scrimmage of masqueraders and\r\n",
      "rather prepared to hear an amused negative.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But yes, of course,\" he answered; \"costume balls, fancy fairs,\r\n",
      "cafe chantant, casino, anything that is not real life appeals to us\r\n",
      "Russians.  Real life with us is the sort of thing that Maxim Gorki\r\n",
      "deals in.  It interests us immensely, but we like to get away from\r\n",
      "it sometimes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Madame Kelnicort came up with another prospective partner, and\r\n",
      "Elaine delivered her ukase:  one more dance and then back to the\r\n",
      "hotel.  Without any special regret she made her retreat from the\r\n",
      "revel which Courtenay was enjoying under the impression that it was\r\n",
      "life and the young Russian under the firm conviction that it was\r\n",
      "not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine breakfasted at her aunts' table the next morning at much her\r\n",
      "usual hour.  Courtenay was sleeping the sleep of a happy tired\r\n",
      "animal.  He had given instructions to be called at eleven o'clock,\r\n",
      "from which time onward the Neue Freie Presse, the Zeit, and his\r\n",
      "toilet would occupy his attention till he appeared at the luncheon\r\n",
      "table.  There were not many people breakfasting when Elaine arrived\r\n",
      "on the scene, but the room seemed to be fuller than it really was\r\n",
      "by reason of a penetrating voice that was engaged in recounting how\r\n",
      "far the standard of Viennese breakfast fare fell below the\r\n",
      "expectations and desires of little Jerome and the girls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If ever little Jerome becomes President of the United States,\"\r\n",

      "article on his gastronomic likes and dislikes to the papers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The aunts were discreetly inquisitive as to the previous evening's\r\n",
      "entertainment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If Elaine would flirt mildly with somebody it would be such a good\r\n",

      "not the only attractive young man in the world.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elaine, however, did not gratify their hopes; she referred to the\r\n",
      "ball with the detachment she would have shown in describing a\r\n",
      "drawing-room show of cottage industries.  It was not difficult to\r\n",
      "discern in her description of the affair the confession that she\r\n",
      "had been slightly bored.  From Courtenay, later in the day, the\r\n",
      "aunts received a much livelier impression of the festivities, from\r\n",
      "which it was abundantly clear that he at any rate had managed to\r\n",
      "amuse himself.  Neither did it appear that his good opinion of his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was late afternoon by the banks of a swiftly rushing river, a\r\n",
      "river that gave back a haze of heat from its waters as though it\r\n",
      "were some stagnant steaming lagoon, and yet seemed to be whirling\r\n",
      "onward with the determination of a living thing, perpetually eager\r\n",
      "and remorseless, leaping savagely at any obstacle that attempted to\r\n",
      "stay its course; an unfriendly river, to whose waters you committed\r\n",
      "yourself at your peril.  Under the hot breathless shade of the\r\n",
      "trees on its shore arose that acrid all-pervading smell that seems\r\n",
      "to hang everywhere about the tropics, a smell as of some monstrous\r\n",
      "musty still-room where herbs and spices have been crushed and\r\n",
      "distilled and stored for hundreds of years, and where the windows\r\n",
      "have seldom been opened.  In the dazzling heat that still held\r\n",
      "undisputed sway over the scene, insects and birds seemed\r\n",
      "preposterously alive and active, flitting their gay colours through\r\n",
      "the sunbeams, and crawling over the baked dust in the full swing\r\n",
      "and pursuit of their several businesses; the flies engaged in\r\n",
      "Heaven knows what, and the fly-catchers busy with the flies.\r\n",
      "Beasts and humans showed no such indifference to the temperature;\r\n",
      "the sun would have to slant yet further downward before the earth\r\n",
      "would become a fit arena for their revived activities.  In the\r\n",
      "sheltered basement of a wayside rest-house a gang of native\r\n",
      "hammock-bearers slept or chattered drowsily through the last hours\r\n",
      "of the long mid-day halt; wide awake, yet almost motionless in the\r\n",
      "thrall of a heavy lassitude, their European master sat alone in an\r\n",
      "upper chamber, staring out through a narrow window-opening at the\r\n",
      "native village, spreading away in thick clusters of huts girt\r\n",
      "around with cultivated vegetation.  It seemed a vast human ant-\r\n",
      "hill, which would presently be astir with its teeming human life,\r\n",
      "as though the Sun God in his last departing stride had roused it\r\n",
      "with a careless kick.  Even as Comus watched he could see the\r\n",
      "beginnings of the evening's awakening.  Women, squatting in front\r\n",
      "of their huts, began to pound away at the rice or maize that would\r\n",
      "form the evening meal, girls were collecting their water pots\r\n",
      "preparatory to a walk down to the river, and enterprising goats\r\n",
      "made tentative forays through gaps in the ill-kept fences of\r\n",
      "neighbouring garden plots; their hurried retreats showed that here\r\n",

      "had not been able to plough his way through more than two-thirds of\r\n",

      "of advertisement, and these the exile scanned with a hungry\r\n",
      "intentness that the romance itself could never have commanded.  The\r\n",
      "name of a shop, of a street, the address of a restaurant, came to\r\n",
      "him as a bitter reminder of the world he had lost, a world that ate\r\n",
      "and drank and flirted, gambled and made merry, a world that debated\r\n",

      "forest paths and steamy swamps or lying in the grip of fever.\r\n",

      "the Straw Exchange Theatre; they seemed to make a little more real\r\n",
      "the past that was already so shadowy and so utterly remote.  For a\r\n",
      "moment he could almost capture the sensation of being once again in\r\n",
      "those haunts that he loved; then he looked round and pushed the\r\n",

      "He had loved himself very well and never troubled greatly whether\r\n",
      "anyone else really loved him, and now he realised what he had made\r\n",
      "of his life.  And at the same time he knew that if his chance were\r\n",
      "to come again he would throw it away just as surely, just as\r\n",
